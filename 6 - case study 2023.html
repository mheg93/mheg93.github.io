    <div class="details-section">
        <h2>The feeling returns</h2>
        <p> Four and a half years after the discussion we had, and the feelings that led to it; the feeling returns. Initially, I don’t recognise it as the same problem. I think it’s the result of a very difficult month; that has been very stressful on us both, for different reasons. In my mind, we were both too stressed, and too focused on ourselves to absorb the other’s bad mood or care for the needs of one another. There is truth to that, but it’s not the whole story. I thought about what you said, and I agree there is more. </p>
<p> This month, in addition to our own individual stress, we tried to take a big step forward, without having truly discussed the specifics of that steps to ensure we were on the same page. We didn’t consider the possibility of any cultural clashes; we didn’t discuss the timing of the steps to follow and we each had our own ideas on what this would look like. We approached this step as individuals not as a couple. We were not on the same page, but we also didn’t try to be; which was unusual. </p>
<p> We tried to move before having a clear and shared vision we could move towards. We also failed to identify each other’s fears, addressing each other’s concerns or trying to reach each other when it became apparent we weren’t on the same page.  We didn’t need to get too specific, but we didn’t even get it in general terms. Again, this was unusual for the two of us, who always talk and take each other’s feelings into account. I thought about what you said, and you are right, there is something deeper. </p>
<p> In my mind, whatever the problem was; which led us to ignore each other, focus on only ourselves and not try to address each other’s emotions or concerns was something new. In fact, the only similar thing I could think of happened 4.5 years before. I looked at it this way; 1 problem every 4.5 years is a very good statistic, and an indicator we would live a very happy life together. No problem. </p>
<p> My clever khosghellam, my observant cookie, thought differently. She wasn’t thinking like a statistician, but as a detective. She looked at the two incidents and drew a connection; she felt the same way; pressured and suffocated. It was just as intense and just as worrying, so she asked; was it ever solved or was it just ignored and bubbling under the surface? </p>
<p> We talked, but cookie Jaan didn’t phrase it like that. Instead she talked about three different things: </p>
<ol>
1.	<li>I am too persuasive. She wonders if my ability to persuade others, is allowing me to persuade her into making decisions or liking things she wouldn’t choose herself. That I was in a sense, killing who she was with every discussion.</li><br>

2.	<li>She doesn’t feel heard. I belittle her thoughts, and don’t take them seriously. I don’t listen to her. I’m only eager to get my own thoughts and points across. When she expresses something, I dismiss it as silly or not true; its only my point of view that matters.</li><br>

3.	<li>I exhaust her. I’m too persistent and I don’t give up. She worries, what if she isn’t agreeing to my points of view. What if I’m just outlasting and exhausting her. What if I just use my stamina to get what I want. </li><br>
</ol>
<p> I get annoyed when she says this, and scared. Has she always felt this way? If so, why is she only saying it now? In any case, this is only the first time we discuss any of these issues. Given time, we will handle it, just as we’ve handled everything else. </p>
<p> I’ve considered each and every point in depth. I’ve reflected on my actions and what my khosghellam is feeling. Initially I disagree: </p>
<ol>
1.	Do I persuade her to think and do things she doesn’t want? The truth is, I’ve never been able to get my khosghellam to do anything she doesn’t want to do herself. I can’t trick her, force her, convince her or talk her into anything she doesn’t already want. It’s one of the reasons I love my khoshgellam; she is strong and I’m no match for her will. <br>

2.	Do I not listen to her? I couldn’t believe she said that, I place more value on her opinion and thoughts than my own. I frequently call her my voice of reason and I mean it. Anything she says, I consider in every possible way, and many times I do it even if I’m not personally convinced, because I trust her judgement. <br>

3.	Do I exhaust her? The truth is I love talking to her, it’s one of my favourite things. But I don’t have the ability to exhaust her into agreeing to anything. My khosghellam mind has always been her own. Moreover, when this point came up, we created the safe word ‘fandogh’ just to avoid that scenario, and it had worked like a charm. <br>
</ol>
<p> I stop my thoughts in it’s tracks at this point. I ask a different question; does it matter if I’m right? Not at all. <em style=”colour: red; font-weight: bolder;”> It only matters that my khoshgellam feels that way </em>. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="details-section odd" id="mistake">
<h3>Thinking differently</h3>
<p>This led me to a different way of thinking. Instead of arguing, I started asking myself why does she feel this way? I started looking at it from her perspective, and I started understanding what she said. </p>
<p>I called her the very next day, I explained what I believed her perspective to be at college green. She said I was right, I finally understood. In my mind, we had identified the issues, we can start fixing them. But I noticed my khoshgellam didn’t feel the same. I had stopped paying attention, I was relieved and trying to control my fear of what would happen if she didn’t see it my way. I started doing the exact same things she didn’t like: arguing like I’m in court, talking too long and dismissing her thoughts. </p>
<p>We spoke again one week after. She had thought about it, and felt that I was missing the point. This was the same issue we had in 2019. It was always there she tried to say. I was again dismissive. I explained that we had solved it, that it had not come up in 4.5 years. I spoke for a very long time but never really listened. </p>
<p>I was scared I would lose my khoshgellam; My Sahi Jaan. In my mind we are meant for each other. I would tear my heart out of it’s chest for her. I start arguing like I’m in court. I say I want to hear her, but in reality I’m so focused on getting her to see my point, because I don’t want to loose her. </p>
<p>I get home, I calm myself down. Then I really start to think about what she was saying. Instead of saying she is wrong; we belong together. I remind myself, facts don’t matter. Only her feelings do. Why does she feel this way? Why would she be right, and I wrong? </p>
<p>I remembered something else. One of the reasons my khoshgellam said she loves me, is because I always make the effort to understand her; and am eventually able to express what she can’t quite put into words sometimes. </p>

<p>I start looking deeper I start noticing similarities between 2019 and now: </p>
<ol>
1.	<li>They both did feel the same; not just for her, but also for me: I feel scared, hurt and ignored; She feels pressured and suffocated. </li>

2.	<li>They both led to very intense reactions from both of us: I get overwhelming and her first instinct is to pull away. </li>

3.	<li>Both events took place during a very difficult period in my life; where a family member was seriously ill and when I was feeling overwhelmed and alone. </li>

4.	<li>In both instances, my khoshgellam pointed to a number of reasons she felt that way: (2019) no me time and honey jaan is constantly around; (2023) I’m too persuasive and she is getting resentful. </li>
</ol>
<p>I think about the last one long and hard. Then I wonder: what if my khosghellam reasons are things that she is thinking; but not really the source of this feeling.  After all these are separate issues, they should feel differently. What if she herself hasn’t quite identified the issue yet; but it is the same issue. </p>
<p>I wonder, is it our personalities. Do we have a personality clash? My khoshgellam thought so. But no matter how much I tried to arrive at that conclusion I couldn’t. A personality issue would constantly be present. We have been together over 5 years, and this issue has come up very few times (khoshgellam herself said so). It only got explosive twice. </p>
<p>A personality clash would be present very often. It would lead to many fights, many arguments and we would not be able to help it. We definitely wouldn’t have lasted long; because its something we can’t change and once the situation was calm, we would fight again. I know what it looks like. </p>
<p><em style=”color: organge; font-weight: bolder”> I started looking at something else instead: our fears. </em></p>
<p>That is when I struck gold. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="details-section">
        <h2>Cookie fear/trigger: loosing freedom - living in a cage.</h2>
           <p> I started by remembering what my khoshgellam told me in the first few months of getting to know each other. It was the same thing she told me on the day she decided to be my cookie and take me as her honey Jan:</p>
<p> My khoshgellam is most afraid of losing her freedom. She is afraid of being in a cage of losing her sense of self. </p>
<p> In essence, this is a fear of being helpless of: not having control over her life, having someone else make her decisions, being a passenger and not the driver. </p>
<em> This is precisely the fear that was triggered both in 2019 and 2023. </em>:
<p> My khoshgellam is triggered. The feeling is so intense, so overwhelming, that it doesn’t matter if it happens twice or even once. Cookie tried to explain this on the beach. It’s the intensity, not the quantity. In the moment those feelings are awakened, they are all that matter. </p>

<h3>Reaction</h3>
<p> My khoshgellam has only one reaction. ESCAPE. Her mind, heart and soul scream: I MUST ESCAPE. </p>

<p> Ironically, my khoshgellam is very claustrophobic, she doesn’t like tight spaces. The second she is in a tight space, she pushes in every direction, hits everywhere. She fights to escape. </p>

<p> This is exactly the same. When my khoshgellam is triggered her first and only instinct is to pull away. To leave this suffocating place. Anything else is unimportant or secondary. Only her feeling, the pressure the inability to breath or see matters. </p>

<p> If khoshgellam doesn’t do something right now, she is going to lose herself and be a caricature of the person she wants to be. She will waste her life and the sacrifice of others. She will be resentful and trapped forever. </p>

<p> In 2019, the second you got triggered, your first reaction, the first thing you think about is to leave the relationship. You didn’t want to think about understanding what was going on, working on it, holding on to each other, anything. You identify things that had been bothering you, but you cant really put your finger on why you are getting this feeling. All that matters is it’s there. </p>

<p> You start fearing it might have been there all along. Maybe I, your jailer, is forcing you into this. it doesn’t matter that you chose to spend your time with me, it doesn’t matter that you are happy around me, it doesn’t matter that we took our time, and it doesn’t matter that you love me. All that matters is this feeling, and this feeling only. You were triggered, you must escape. </p>

<p> I started taking steps to address the problems you raised. You stopped feeling suffocated or pressured. The feeling started going away. Unwittingly, even though we didn’t deal with the root of the problem, you started getting de-triggered. </p>

<p> Once you were de-triggered, you chose to stay with me every day for 4.5 years. You didn’t get triggered much in this period, and everytime something came up; we addressed it immediately. Though we did so because we are so compatible and caring. We didn’t realise we were doing it. </p>

<p> It’s only in the past month that you got triggered again. My khoshgellam herself said, it’s only at the start of this month that she started reconsidering everything. The feeling came back. Then she got triggered. </p>

<p> Her immediate response again. Escape  and so history repeats itself. </p>
  </div>


    <div class="details-section odd" id="mistake">
        <h2>Honey fear/trigger: insecurity and self-doubt – Am I enough.</h2>
           <p> After I understood my khosghellam’s trigger and response, I started thinking about my own. I can be very slow to understand my own feelings, and my fear is different and far more insidious. </p>
<p> I can get very insecure about things I truly care about.  That is my trigger. It’s not an attractive quality, but it’s my biggest flaw. </p>
<p> My fear is that I’m not enough. I put so much of myself into everything I do, the people I love, my biggest fear is it’s not enough. </p>
<p> I get triggered, when I feel insecure about something and can’t either reassure myself or find the reassurance I’m looking for. It escalates very quickly in my mind until I address it correctly. </p>
<p> I man a very simple man, I don’t want much and am easily satisfied. However, I am equally ambitious and work very hard. My projected confidence, arrogance some would say, blinds people around me. Doubt and insecurity can be my worst enemies. It’s why I really struggle to truly go for it sometimes. </p>
<p> It’s the reason I was so hesitant to apply for medicine; I feared I wouldn’t be accepted. t’s the reason getting rejected from oxford/Cambridge hurt so much; I went for it and was rejected. It’s the reason every pupillage rejection hurts so much; I tried my best but was not worthy. </p>
<p> My reaction. Fight, prove yourself to yourself. Do it just to fail, then work your way to win. Loosing hurts, but never surprises me. Because deep inside, when I’m feeling insecure, think I’m not good enough. </p>
<p> Winning is sweet because, not just because I have succeeded, but because I get to reassure myself silence my doubt and insecurity. </p>
<p> In 2019, I was in a very vulnerable situation already, because I learned of my grandmother’s illness. it’s especially easy to trigger my fear response when I’m in that state of mind. </p>
<p> This made it easier for me to feel insecure about our relationship during that period, it also didn’t help that nawid (who at the time didn’t know we were togther) had asked you out. </p>
<p> I got triggered. I started wondering if you loved me? if you wanted me? all questions you had answered before. Things you showed everyday. But in that moment, I was triggered and my fear was driving. I wasn’t thinking rationally. </p>
<p> At my most vulnerable, I even started wondering if I even deserved you. Maybe my karma was to get hurt, as I hurt another; which is a thought I never shared with anyone. It was a manifestation of my good heart; i.e. I did something bad and I deserved to get punished. It’s easy for me to have these thoughts when I’m triggered, even though I know its not true. </p>
<p> I reacted by focusing all my attention into looking for some reassurance to ease my fear and clear my heart. I didn’t communicate my need correctly, instead of reassuring me, the exact opposite happened; my khoshgellam started pulling away. </p>
<p> I tried only to resolve the issues she raised, I didn’t truly understand or think very deeply about the root cause; even though it was in front of my face. I never really tried to resolve my understand or resolve my own issue. </p>
<p> You dealt with the symptoms of it as well. By reassuring me whenever I asked, doing things like adjusting playtime or taking steps to make me feel more included in your life. But you didn’t truly understand the root cause either. </p>
<p> Our compatibility, love and eagerness to take care of each other meant we were mostly trigger free for 4.5 years. But we didn’t truly understand or deal with the root cause. </p>
<p> Its only in the past month that I got triggered again. Similarly, I am in a very vulnerable state of mind. This makes it easier for me to get in an insecure state of mind. Instead of appreciating all the positive things “parents talking” “my parents being invited” “your family inviting me”. </p>
<p> I was triggered. My immediate response I started looking for reassurance “do you want me?” “we are engaged” “we don’t talk a lot” etc.  and so history repeats itself</p>
    </div>


    <div class="details-section">
        <h2> The mistake</h2>
          <p> We never fully understood the root cause of all this: 1) your fear of losing your freedom – 2) my insecurity and fears. </p>
<p>I started asking, why didn’t this escalate into similar explosive situations throughout the past five years. My khoshgellam herself said, most of our time has been amazing and happy. </p>
<p>When cookie thought about it, she even said it must have happened at times and we ignore it, because our reactions are too extreme. khoshgellam however agreed, it wasn’t there most of the time and it only ever got to this stage twice. </p>
<p>I think I know why: </p>
<ol>
<li> We don’t get triggered often. Even though these are fears we each have as individuals (and will likely always have whether we are alone or together), its rare that it gets activated. </li><br>
<li> It’s very rare that we get triggered at the same time. This means that one of us is always able to de-escalate and comfort the other person. So it never escalates. </li><br>
<li> We are incredibly compatible. Each of us has exactly what the other person needs. That’s why we instinctively know what to do to calm and understand each other. That’s why it has worked for so long, even though we didn’t fully understand these fears in ourselves and each other. </li><br>

</ol>

<p>Another mistake is we never really talked about 2019 once the feeling went away, there was no reason to. I tried to pretend it never happened, because it made me tense and sad. </p>
<p>This was not the right approach. It prevented us from analysing what happened with a cool head. Had we done so, we would have identified the root cause and this will likely never have happened, because we would have recognised what was happening and dealt with it correctly. </p>

    <div class="details-section odd" id="mistake">
<h3>Parents coming first time</h3>
<p>Another obstacle was my own lack of self knowledge. I sometimes struggle to explain what I’m feeling and understand why I’m feeling it. This makes it difficult to address them correctly. </p>
<p>For example: I brought up my khoshgellam’s parents first coming multiple times. Cookie thought I was holding on to it and trying to make her feel bad. That wasn’t the case. I brought it up because I was trying to understand and express what I was feeling. </p>
<p>Every time I tried, I wouldn’t quite get it. I would say things I want to take back. It just wasn’t coming out right. I would leave and still feel I didn’t say what I wanted or was feeling, so id want to try again. </p>
<p>This led me to try and rationalise what I was feeling; I talked about practicality, getting to know the family, them getting to know me. But in reality, I was starting to get triggered. </p>
<p>My fear woke up: “what if you are not enough after all”, “does she really love you?”, “does she want you?”, does she think you are worth exploring this step with. I reacted by searching for assurance, distancing myself when I didn’t get it to limit my pain. </p>
<p>I didn’t understand what was happening, and neither did my khoshgellam. So my cookie started getting annoyed started getting annoyed. My khoshgellam started getting annoyed and pushed back. Cookie’s focus became “I’m sorry you think that but I didn’t do anything wrong” to free herself. She tried to talk to my brain, not my heart. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="details-section" id="necklace">
<h3> Necklace </h3>
<p>Ironically, This is exactly what happened with the necklace as well. I wanted it as a symbol of assurance. Something I can touch in my moments of doubt. I asked my khoshgellam to get me one, I didn’t get it immediately. I kept asking. </p>

<p> My cookie felt pressured, she refused and pushed back. Nothing I did would budge her (further proof I can never get her to do something you don’t want). This didn’t become a big issue because our compatibility helped us. </p>

<p> I dealt with my emotions myself and let it go. Ironically, when I let it go, she felt the pressure go away and got me one because she did want to; I felt happier than I can tell her. </p>
</div>


    <div class="details-section odd" id="mistake">
        <h2> The incident: 2023</h2>

           <p> Let’s break this down from both our perspectives, by applying my theory on us being triggered and reacting accordingly.
<h3 style =”colour: red;”> My perspective </h3>
<p> I am completely overwhelmed. For the first time in a very long time, I genuinely feel overwhelmed and am drowning. </p>
<p> I’m in an especially vulnerable state of mind, and really have been since my father got ill in Egypt. Finding out my uncle was ill, terrified me and amplified my anxiety. This put me in a very fear oriented state of mind, which in turn made it easy for my insecurities to be triggered. </p>
<p> The stress and pressure I experienced was unreal. I started to push back against that feeling and reacted by looking for any kind of reassurance to calm my heart down. I didn’t do this consciously; as it turns out I’m not very in touch with my emotions and don’t always know what I’m feeling. </p>
<p> I started wanting to reassure myself that you love me and want me. I ask those questions a lot, I insist we are engaged and I lash out at my khoshgellam. In reality, I really was trying to reach out because I really wanted help and support, but it wouldn’t come out right. </p>
<p> Khoshgellam starts to pull away, my insecurities get much worse because I’m triggered. I’m far too stressed and need, desperately, any kind of reassurance, anything to cut through the sea of fear, stress and panic I had been drowning in for a month. </p>
<p>  I started to push back, not against her, but against that feeling. I asked the questions directly “do you love me? Do you want me?” “are we engaged (was never about culture or engagement, though I didn’t realise, I just wanted to be reassured</p>
<p> I try to control myself. I try to express gratitude at being invited to spend time with kimia, or her sister. I try to express gratitude at being invited for lunch and try to calm myself with parents calling. </p>
<p> I try to help with job interview preparations, and try to do little things like go with her to the station, pick her up. Khoshgellam gets the job and I’m very very happy for her. But it also makes me even more insecure. </p>
<p> We will move away from each other, what will happen. I need to reassure myself somehow. I can’t think anymore. Just to know she loves and wants me. I try to find comfort in taking steps towards getting serious. </p>
<p> Meanwhile the jobs I had been applying for rejected me. I cant even show her family that I have a better income or that I can progress. I’m worried her sister sees me as so much less. Maybe they’ll think I’m a failure. So I don’t want to talk about specific plans until I have something concrete to impress them with. </p>
<p> All the while more issues are happening with family members who are very close to me. My cousin is relying on me to get him into university. Many fights are breaking out in the family. And other people are falling ill. This makes me more anxious. </p>
<p> After our parents talk, my parents explain to me that in our culture, the engagement has started and congratulate me because the parents are now talking. I’m so confused, but I try to confirm this with my khoshgellam to get some kind of internal stability; reassure my insecurity. </p>
<p> This is not what engagement is for her and she pushes back. Nothing is reassuring me, I’m getting resistance with everything I’m doing. Maybe she doesn’t want me, maybe she doesn’t love me after all. I try to find out, but she just won’t say it straight and keeps dodging my questions. I just want a straight answer, anything to calm me that she wants and loves me. But I never receive it. My reaction is to press harder. </p>
<p> I reach my breaking point, snap in a way. Its too much pressure in my mind; and nothing to ease my fears or doubts to de-trigger me. I don’t recognise this happening at the time and didn’t understand this happens until recently. </p>
    </div>
          
        <div class="details-section">

<h3 style=”colour: green;”> Khoshgellam perspective </h3>
<p> My khoshgellam is dealing with her own stress. Her family is here, she misses them and wants to spend time with them; it doesn’t happen often. </p>
<p> She starts worrying about their health, it’s been a while since she saw them and she is concerned that they look older, are slightly less fit. She is also concerned about her other family members that are old and struggling with different illnesses. She is worried about her mother and father’s reaction to those illnesses and wants to ease their burden. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, she still isn’t able to get a job. Khoshgellam is worried about her future. Should she stay here and continue trying.  She has already tried so hard and can’t get anywhere. Is it a lost cause, and should she go home? </p>
<p> She then has an interview, she doesn’t quite get the job she wants. She is worried, is this job a step in the right direction or is it a downgrade. Cookie is worried about the move she would have to make, how would she feel in this new place, the people there and having to rebuild her life. </p>
<p> What about the future steps after this contract expires. It is not the best university to work at, is it going to help take her to where she wants to go, will she be stuck? </p>
<p> She is under immense pressure. Throughout all of this, her partner keeps nagging her. She must manage his feelings as well. Why does she have to do that? He’s not being understanding at all. </p>
<p> In fact he is adding a lot of pressure on her. He’s unhappy about everything, he wants to be invited, but that’s not how cookie’s culture works. She is trying to manage his image to her family, but he is not recognising this at all. </p>
<p> He doesn’t appreciate anything she is doing. Khoshgellam is trying to call him more often, visit him more often. But he doesn’t even notice and keeps complaining. She sends him gifts from her mother, invites him out with her sister on her birthday, invites him to her home for lunch and all he does is complain. </p>
<p> He wants to get engaged and married. It’s scary, he is moving so fast. Why is he being so rash? We don’t even know anything: he doesn’t have a job, we don’t know where we want to live, we don’t know what our timeline is on kids? </p>
<p> Khoshgellam tries to be understanding at first, tries to gently brings it up. Then he corners her about their parents talking. He puts so much pressure so she agrees to the phone call. She wanted the parents to talk, but after he starts pressuring her like that, she is not feeling as good or certain about it. </p>
<p> The call happens, then he comes back and starts saying we are engaged!! What the hell is he talking about, our parents haven’t even met yet. He pressures me more, he keeps insisting we are engaged or break it off???? </p>
<p> I don’t want this to end, but he is holding me hostage. So much pressure and I have a lot on my mind already. We need to slow down, but he’s not letting us. I can’t talk to him. He’s not listening to me, just pushing what he wants. </p>
<p> He’s even initiated play with me two times, even though he knows I don’t want to do that with my parents here. Maybe he really can’t control himself, khoshgellam tried to make him feel better a bit. </p>
<p> But will it be like this, what I want is not important. Is this even my choice anymore? Is this what he is really like?  Do I even want to get married or is this just what he wants? Do I even want. </p>
<p> What about our future together?? This is the first real decision we make, and he’s already trying to control me? Will he force me to have kids before I’m ready? What if I really want to move away, will he drag me back? </p>
<p> He comes and says to take a break. Relief, The pressure is gone, she can breathe and think. She wonders if she should be feeling this way. Then he comes back and the pressure comes again. She needs to escape</p>
<p> Khoshgellam wonders, Can I be myself around him? Can I have the life I want???? This isn’t me!!! I’m going to disappear, become resentful. </p>
<p> My khoshgellam starts pushes back. Every time he asks me if I love him or want him. Why do I have to keep answering these questions. I don’t want to answer now. The more insistently he asks, the more important it is to resist. </p>
<p> He wants to do this his way, why? We need to slow down. In fact, lets postpone the parents meeting. Let’s have them talk over telephone instead and take this at a pace I like. The more he insists the more important it is to resist. </p>
<p> Finally, my khoshgellam snapped in a way as well. She sees life as being a cage. She must escape. </p>

         <h3> Analysis: why i was rushing and why you were pulling away </h3>
      <p> I get scared, I press for reassurance without communicating it properly. She feels pressured and starts to pull away. All I feel is insecurity and all you feel is helplessness/caged. I feel you don’t cherish me, you feel I suffocate you and on it goes. </p>
<p> By the time I calmed myself a little, you did the same thing. Because you felt pressured suffocated. He is taking my freedom, by very sense of self. Staying with him will make me resentful. I must escape. </p>
<<p> Our focus becomes to defend ourselves, not address or listen to what the other says:
1.	 I say to myself, I have don’t nothing to make you feel pressured. “Why do you feel suffocated?” That, I now realise is the worst question to ask. The focus becomes finding the things that make you feel pressured/suffocated, instead of working on making you feel free and secure. Instead of acknowledging your feeling of helplessness I was dismissive. “it’s not a big deal” “it’s very fixable” “it’s not the same thing”, even when I wanted to address it. The way in which I went about it increased the issue.

2.	Khoshgellam does the same she makes remarks like “I already answered that, why do I have to say it again”, “stop asking me questions”, “I don’t want to answer now”. The phrase “I think you are a good one” became an irrational trigger for me. This increased my insecurity and fears, which made me shut down.

<p> We didn’t reassure one another in the way we need, so we stayed triggered, and the situation escalated. Instead of asking </p>
<ol>
1.	<li>What can I do to give her back the feeling of being in control of her decisions? </li>
2.	<li>Making her concerns feel heard and valid? </li>
3.	<li>What can I do to reassure him I love and want him, that he is my choice? </li>
4.	<li>How can I make him feel we are in this together, he is not alone? </li>
</ol> 
<p> One of the main issues is when we got triggered, we never communicated our need or fear clearly. We disguised it in logic and other issues; not because we don’t want to, but because we don’t ourselves understand. All we focus on is the negative, we can’t even see what is good anymore. Our fear takes centre stage. </p>
<p> This created a bad environment for both of us. We are deteriorating and need support. But we cant get it because we don’t even know what we need from the other or even exactly what we are feeling (that was the case for me). </p>
<p> In my case I started I was working day and night (cases, virtual internships, job applications, coding, gym, mini-pupillage applications and connected with a new mentor) anything. In that time, I’ve lost 7 kg, earned 4 certificates, got rejected from two jobs, did countless cases and learned how to code in HTML and CSS. I now realise this was my attempt to escape, which made it worse each time those feelings came up. </p>
<p> Though we did both need some space to refresh our minds and get some perspective. To recognise what was going on. The way we did it initially wasn’t right, because we were both trying to escape each other; not hold hands and tackle the matter together. </p>

        <h2> A clash of reaction – not personality <h2>

          <p> In both 2019 and 2023, we were both triggered. We now understand why that happened. But that’s only half the story. The second half is our reaction to it. </p>
<p> Once we are triggered, this interaction can become a vicious cycle: I put pressure to find the reassurance I need, you feel pressure. This triggers khosghellam fear of feeling helpless of being in a cage. Cookie starts to pull away to resist this pressure, this triggers my insecurity. I start trying harder, so I put more pressure. You feel more pressured, and you pull away harder. </p>
<p> It didn’t happen at any other point because we almost never get triggered at the same time. We are very compatible, super attentive and we truly love each other. This allows us to instinctively address each other’s bad moments and comfort each other correctly: </p>
<p> For example: </p>
<ol>
<li> You start to feel suffocated. I notice this, so I give you space/me time. I stay when you need me, but not interact. I do little things to make you feel supported etc. So you never actually get triggered. Instead you feel grateful, and it makes you happy and you get closer to me. </li> <br>
<li>I start to get insecure. You sit down with me let me talk and express myself in a safe space. You play with me in a way that comforts me, you reassure me with words you know calm me. I never get triggered, I feel reassured and so I’m relaxed and there is no pressure or suffocation. </li>
</ol>
When we are both triggered however, the clash is in the way we respond to a specific fear when we are triggered. It’s not in our personalities; that’s why it happens so very rarely. 
My reaction, which is to for reassurance makes her feel pressured and suffocates. Cookie’s reaction, which is to pull away makes me insecure. We are not often triggered, and we are very rarely triggered at the same time.

        <h2>Addressing this correctly </h2>
               <p> After 2019; we only addressed individual symptoms, not the root cause, we focused only on the actions we did that the other believed caused the ‘problem’. We didn’t really try to understand the fear behind it and address that; so our solution was practical, but didn’t deal with the root cause. </p>
<p> So now we understand it. Can we actually do anything about it? Absolutely. We’ve already done it because. </p>
<p> The key, as i see it is to recognise when each of us is triggered. When we do we can address exactly that need, or know that we need to stop for now and approach the matter differently  </p>
<p> Since we now understand each of our response, this is less likely to trigger us in the future. We understand what is happening, and know it is something the other finds difficult. So we can stop it from escallating. </p>
<p> Like 'fandogh', 'me-time', 'mario', we can put a new measure in place to deal with just that 'trigger or pause'. for example: </p>
<ul>
<li> When I feel my fear of inadequacy/insecurity being triggered, I say: khosghgellam, I’m feeling insecure can we stop just now. I need to feel loved and cherished; can you help me feel that first, then we can get back to what we were discussing? </li>

<li> When she feels trapped, pressured suffocated or not in control, she says: Honey jaan, I’m feeling pressured/suffocated. Can you please give me some space. Help me feel free and in control of myself and decision. Then we can get back to this?</li> 
</ul>
<p> The focus would then be on the correct matter, our feelings in the moment; not whatever practical issue we are discussing. </p>
<p> This will enable us to de-escalate and de-trigger the other; our focus becomes on providing the re-assurance we each need: </p>
<ol>
1.	<li> You that you are free, and in control of your future.</li>
2.	<li> Me, that I am not alone, That you chose, love and cherish me. </li>
</ol>

        <h2> Thoughts </h2>
<p> This is only me thinking for now. Imagine how effective we will be when we think together. We will manage this properly once and for all. This doesnt mean we will never get triggered, but it will mean that we will each know how to deal with this and give the other person exactly what they need. It will also mean that we will have the presance of mind to stop when we are both triggered so we can cool down. </p>

<p> Take this website for example, I made this website (instead of calling/texting) so YOU can freely access. I want to convey information without you feeling pressured. You are completely free not to read it. You are in control here khoshgellam. </p>
<p> I really can't wait to talk about this with you. Because the more we discuss this together, the better our solutions and ability to avoid triggers all together will get. </p>
<br>
<p> There is a moment when you did finally reach my heart khoshgellam. We were sat on the bed in my room , you held my hand and you whispered, from your heart: “I don’t want this to end, I love you </p>
<p> That was the first moment I truly started to get de-triggered. This to me was the moment I realised, you held on despite my terrible state; because you know we love and are good for each other </p>
<p> I tell you now khoshgellam, I don’t want this to end. you are the love of my heart. The light to my shesm and we are good for each other </p> 
<p> I love you with all my dil </p>
