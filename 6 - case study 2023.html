        <h2>The feeling returns</h2>
        <p>
            <p> 4.4 Years later, the feeling returns. I think it is the by-product of a bad month. A month in which both of have been too stressed to compensate or properly care for the needs of one another. A month in which we added more pressure on ourselves, by trying to take a big step forward without either of us addressing the other’s concerns. A month where we were both uncharacteristically selfish and not on the same page. </p>

            <p> I am not as troubled, and I fail to realise my own feelings completely because in my mind it would be unnatural if we have no problems ever and in my mind; two problems every 5 years is a very good statistic (an MSc helps you interpret that). </p>
            
            <p> However, my clever and instinctual khoshgellam wasn’t a statistician in that moment, she was a detective. She asked a different question: was this ever really solved? Or was this problem always there? She is not thinking of me in that moment, only of the “pressure/suffocation” she fears and now feels again. </p>
            
            <p> As we talked, she references something new concerns this time, concerns that had never come up. </p>
            
        <ol> 
            <li> I am too persuasive. She starts to wonder, am I persuading her to adopt thoughts that are not hers. I hope she realises this is something no mere mortal can do, her strength and stubbornness is one of the many reasons I love her. </li> <br><br>
            
            <li> She doesn’t feel heard. I don’t listen to her, in my eagerness to talk myself, I dismiss her thoughts as silly or overlook them all together at times. (I now understand why I do sometimes do that and know what steps I need to take to dimmish that). 
                      <br><br> 
                In a sense, I sometimes mimic my father. Though I lack his experience, skill, and competence. I sometimes try to project it. I truly am listening to every word and consider every little detail (case in point). I change my mind most of the time, because my khosghellam has a way of convincing me, and I trust her judgement more than mine at times. But it doesn’t feel like that. 
                     <br><br>
                 All she feels when I do that, is the pressure of my assertions (You will like this, we will do this, that is silly, noises/facial expressions). My dad does the same with me, and I feel the exact same reaction to rebel, to fight back against the suffocating pressure. Its gone as soon as it comes, because I know he doesn’t mean it, and because its not intended, he is just that passionate; and so am I. It is great but sometime not so good. I noticed this as I was discussing something with him this very week. It was a moment of epiphany, because I felt exactly what she felt, though my reaction is different because I don’t fear losing my freedom in that sense. (I now recognise the signs)
            
            </li><br><br>
            
            <li> I am too persistent. She fears instead of convincing her, I will outlast her. I will make her tired then drown her. What if she is not able to hold on to her point, what if she is not convinced but just surrenders. Another pressure in our discussions to which I had been blind (ironically, my persistence has a negative effect on my I never realised, more on that later). </li> <br><br>
            
        </ol>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="details-section odd">
        <h2>Her biggest fear: living in a cage.</h2>
            <p> All these pressures result in one fundamental feeling: Helplessness. From the beginning, her biggest fear was losing her freedom, losing her very sense of self. This is the fear I have triggered. </p>
        
            <p> Inch by inch, bit by bit she will lose herself. Be trapped in a cage from which there is no escape. Whether her views are dismissed, she accepts something because she is tired of talking, she is suffocated by my presence. It doesn’t matter, the feeling is the same. She will drown and never return. She will lose her freedom to be/do what she wants, even if we want to go in the same direction, it she wouldn’t have made that choice freely. She feels helpless and then resentful. </p>
            
            <p> It is so intense it doesn’t matter if that happens twice or once (as she tried to explain to me near the beach, but I wouldn’t listen due to my own fear). In that moment the fact that it is happening at all is all that matters. </p>
            
            <p> It taps into one of her biggest fears and she reacts just as intensely: “I MUST ESCAPE THIS FEELING” she pulls away. She is afraid, feels she is going to lose herself and be a resentful caricature of who she is meant to be. She is going to lose her freedom and stop being her. She pulls away as hard as she can. </p>    
    </div>


    <div class="details-section">
        <h2>My biggest fear: I’m not good enough.</h2>
            <p> As I considered her fear, I started to think about my own. What if I’m reacting out of fear as well. But my fear is different and far more insidious. One of my biggest fears, the fear she sometimes unintentionally triggers, is the feeling “I’m not enough, I’m not worthy”. </p>

            <p> I man a very simple man, I dont want much and am easily satisfied. However, I am equally ambitious and work very hard. My projected confidence, arrogance some would say, blinds people around me. Doubt is my constant companion. This doubt, insecurity and feeling of inadequacy is my hidden fear and undermines me when it gets the chance. </p>

            <p> It’s the real reason I didn’t apply to become a doctor; I feared I wouldn’t be accepted. It’s the reason getting rejected from oxford/Cambridge hurt so much; proof I wasn’t good enough. It’s why every pupillage rejection, every job rejection hurt so much; conclusive proof, I’m not worthy. </p>

            <p> My reaction. Fight, prove yourself to yourself. Do it just to fail, then work your way to win. Loosing hurts, but never surprises me. Because deep inside, I think I’m not good enough most of the time. Winning is sweet because, not because I have succeeded, but because I get to silence my doubt if only for a little bit. Though I have yet to succeed where it counts (career, promotion, business – all failures so far). This makes me scared. </p>

            <p> How does this apply to this scenario. Its simple. Being chosen by my khoshgellam to be her partner was one of the best feelings I’ve ever had. She is not perfect, but she is perfect in my eyes; amazing in every respect. I was not settling, I was grateful and still feel lucky every minute we are together. To this very second. </p>

            <p> My secret fear is “am I enough for her?”, that dominates my thoughts when I am triggered. “Does she love, value and cherish me?”, “does she see my worth?” and “would she fight to keep me in her life, because she loves me and feels I am worth it?”. </p>

            <p> Sometimes I asked myself “Do I deserve her love?”. Maybe I deserved karma, to get hurt, as I hurt another. I never shared this with anyone, I now realise this is not true. It was a manifestation of my good heart, something I unconsciously manifested. I did something bad, and I deserve to be punished (ironically, this past month has I feel settled my karma in full). In a way, I’m now free of that question. </p>

            <p> At my most vulnerable, at my most scared, these are the thoughts I have just below the surface. They make me jumpy. I seek reassurance. In 2019, that’s exactly the feeling I had. “She is not cherishing me because she doesn’t love me, because I’m not worth it after all”. </p>

            <p> I reacted in search of some reassurance to ease my fear. I didn’t communicate my need correctly, instead of reassuring me, the exact opposite happened; my partner started pulling away. </p>

            <p> I didn’t understand that reaction, I didn’t want to revisit it or think about it. I was foolish. My dominating thought is her first solution to any problem is to leave, she wouldn’t fight for me as I fight for her. This is not true. </p>

            <p> I tried only to resolve her issue, the actions I did that led to the feeling she had. Had I allowed myself to truly examine and talk about it, I would have understood this is her knee jerk response to feeling caged/losing herself (explained above). </p>
    </div>


    <div class="details-section odd" id="mistake">
        <h2> The mistake</h2>
            <p> We never addressed it correctly because we never understood its underlying cause. We never addressed my side of this properly. Her reaction intensified my fear, and I was never able to explain my fear (because I didn’t realise it myself) or properly explore yours. </p>
                
            <p> For 4.3 years, our extreme compatibility helped us (one of the reasons I believe we are perfect for each other). Our innate compassion, goodness, care for each other, and true love helped us. We both dealt with it instinctively when it arose, we calmed one another, one of us was always patient, attentive of the other and in a good frame of mind. We put each other first, and avoided situations in which we were both triggered. One of us would always understand, sometimes her, sometimes me (not just me as my fear brain led me to think at one point). </p>
            
            <p> Both of us agree that most of our time together doesn’t have that issue. Most of our time has been smooth, happy and supportive. Though I understand what she meant, there an undercurrent (even if it rarely manifested) and it existed because while we dealt with the symptoms, we never addressed the root cause. We never addressed the root cause because, we were both satisfied with the solutions we put in place. Happy. Otherwise, it would have come up like now. </p>
            
            <p> Because we didn’t fully understand it and only partially addressed it, we weren’t equipped to deal with it when it came up again. I was in denial (I thought it was dealt with, this is new), she was in despair (We never resolved it, I will lose my freedom and myself, it is hopeless). </p>
          
            --->
            <p> We talked a lot about this incident, but I could never truly explain what was in my heart. I wasn’t understanding it fully myself. I understand as I talk, so I talked. She however got bothered by my bringing it up, she felt I was holding on to it and making her pay. Her focus became “I’m sorry you think that but I didn’t do anything wrong”. She tried to talk to my brain, not my heart. </p>

            <p> I wasn’t holding on to it. I knew I felt something, I wasn’t sure what it was. I wanted to understand. I wanted her to see my feelings. But I couldn’t express myself and each time I would try, I would say things I want to take back, because it wasn’t what I was thinking or feeling. Something was trapped and I was trying to release it. <em>Only do I understand. <em></p>
    
</div>


    <div class="details-section" id="necklace">
        <h2> The necklace</h2>

            <p> In this instance, my fear was triggered when I felt she didn’t love me or want me. I now realised that I felt that after your parents came the first time, and it was festering. I didn’t recognise it at the time. I talked about practicality, getting to know the family, them getting to know me. </p>

            <p> My fear woke up: “what if you are not enough after all”, “does she really love you?”, “does she want you?”, does she think you are worth exploring this step with. I reacted by searching for assurance, distancing myself when I didn’t get it to limit my pain. </p>

            <p> Ironically, you reacted to my reaction. You felt pressured, you started pulling away. Your fear brain switched on and you started to get negative thoughts. </p>

    </div>



    <div class="details-section odd">
        <h2> Back to the future: 2023</h2>
            <p> This time my fear in addition to the stress I was experiencing became overwhelming. For the first time in a long time, I was completely overwhelmed, drowning. </p>
                
            <p> I started to push back, not against her, but against that feeling. I asked the questions directly “do you love me? Do you want me?” “are we engaged (was never about culture or engagement, though I didn’t realise, I just wanted to be reassured that my fears were not true). </p>
            
            <p> I disguised it in logic, we decide if we want each other then talk about practicalities. Once families are involved, only they discuss (I didn’t realise I was doing that at the time). In my mind, of course I knew we needed to discuss important details. One doesn’t just jump into a life together with absolutely no plan. But my fear was driving, it needed to be extinguished. </p>



            <h3> I know why I was rushing </h3>
        <p> The more I asked, the more pressure she felt. The more pressure, the more she denied me the reassurance I needed. Her fear brain switched on. To be fair she did try to resist the impulse to pull away. Her contact with me was limited, but she tried to call me more when I pointed it out. </p>
        
        <p> When I reached my breaking point, where I desperately needed any kind of reassurance, anything to cut through the sea of fear, stress and panic I had been drowning in for a month (something that happened before I fully recovered from what happened to my father in Egypt). </p>
        
        <p> To be fair, she did (instinctively) try to resist her own impulse to pull away; my khoshgellam. But she couldn’t fully suppress it. She (and i) didn’t understand the real issue, how could we begin to deal with it. </p>
        
        <p> when I reached my breaking point (we engaged or we call it off) she pulled us back, and tried to calm down the conversation (though she didn’t assure me in the way I wanted, I never communicated it).  </p>
        
        <p> When we were sat on my bed, she asked me to stop she doesn’t want to answer these questions now, we should calm down. I was gone at that point. She wasn’t even talking to me, just my stress given voice. </p>
        
        <p> She tearfully whispers <em>“why are you rushing?” </em> most importantly, the reason I am doing all this “I don’t want this to end”. </p>

        <p> She is starting to get through to me. That one sentance "I don’t want this to end" reached my heart. This snaps me out of it somewhat. I take her in my arms I try to tell her how much I love her, I don’t want this to end either.  </p>
    
        <p>She is the highlight of my day everyday, this is still the truth to this very second, this is why not talking to her is so hard for me. She is my love, I truly hope I am hers </p>
    </div>


    <div class="details-section">
        <h2> A stupid reaction</h2>

            <p> The second she left, my fear took over again. My parents, recognise my stress somewhat and place it to my uncertainty over what she feels. They don’t understand the dynamic and mental state we were both in. Then again neither did we. </p>
            
            <p> I go the next day and tell her she needs to take time to think about whether she loves me or not. My fear completely won, and I went to my second reaction when I am not assured. Distance, coldness. Something, I now realise, I do to numb the pain I feel in my heart. </p>
            
            <p> I do something we had never done in our relationship. I suggest distance, I openly doubt her feelings and commitment, the little sane part of me at the time tries to reassure her I’m all in. But I didn’t understand what I was doing. </p>
            
            <p> Throughout I couldn’t even appreciate that they were ill and not feeling well. I didn’t recognise that I had been taken to the graduation dinner, fed from the family meals, treated with genuine love by her and her family. </p>
            
            <p> All I remembered was being cut from the picture. This was natural. I was not part of her family yet. But in my mind, it was her telling me she didn’t want me to be a part of her family. My mind was only looking for the negative. </p>
            
            <p> My fear and stress created a bad environment. I needed help, support. But I couldn’t get it because I didn’t even know what I need or what I was feeling. I was working day and night (cases, virtual internships, job applications, coding, gym, mini-pupillage applications and connected with a new mentor) anything. In that time, I’ve lost 7 kg, earned 4 certificates, got rejected from two jobs, did countless cases and learned how to code in HTML and CSS. I now realise this was my attempt to escape, which made it worse each time those feelings came up. </p>
        
            <p> Though we did both need some space to refresh our minds and get some perspective. To recognise what was going on. This was not the way, it was a mistake</p>
    </div>


    <div class="details-section odd">
        <h2> Analysing our bad response</h2>
                <p>I get scared, I press for reassurance without communicating it properly. She feels pressured and starts to pull away. All I feel is insecurity and all you feel is helplessness. I feel you don’t cherish me, you feel I suffocate you and on it goes. </p>
                
                <p>By the time I calmed myself a little, you did the same thing. Because you felt pressured suffocated. He is taking my freedom, by very sense of self. Staying with him will make me resentful. I must escape. </p>

                <p>Instead of asking myself: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> “What can I do so you feel free?”. </li><br><br>
                    <li> “What can I do so you secure and in control?”</li>
                </ul>

            <p>I say to myself, I have don’t nothing to make you feel pressured. “Why do you feel suffocated?” That, I now realise is the worst question to ask. The focus becomes finding the things that make you feel pressured/suffocated, instead of working on making you feel free and secure. </p>

            <p>Instead of acknowledging your feeling of helplessness I was dismissive. “it’s not a big deal” “it’s very fixable” “it’s not the same thing”, even when I wanted to address it. The way in which I went about it increased the issue. </p>


            <p>Your reaction was very similar. Instead of asking yourself: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> What can I say or do to reassure him that I love him? </li><br><br>
                    <li> How can I make him feel I’m in this with him, he is not alone?</li><br><br>
                </ol>

            <p>You make remarks like “I already answered that, why do I have to say it again”, “stop asking me questions”, “I don’t want to answer now”. The phrase “I think you are a good one” became an irrational trigger for me.  This increased my insecurity and fears, which made me shut down. </p>


    </div>


    <div class="details-section" id="personality">
        <h2> A personality clash or something else?</h2>

            <p> In one talk, she said our issue might be a personality clash. Something we can never avoid or change. </p>
            
            <p> She are my voice of reason. I think about every letter she says long and hard, and I considered it. I came to a different conclusion </p>
                
             <p> A clash of personality means that we would be unable to interact for any long period of time without having a problem. A clash of personality would show itself in every day tasks and very frequently. When we spoke about our time together. This is not the case. In fact, our time together has been mostly happy and joyful, to the point that BOTH OF US were taking real steps towards getting married </p>
                
            <p> This is different. It is a clash, but of the way we respond to a specific fear when we are triggered. My reaction, which is to for reassurance makes her feel pressured and suffocates. Her reaction, which is to pull away makes me insecure. We are not often triggered, and we are very rarely triggered at the same time.  </p> 
        
            
            <p> In the past, we could only address individual symptoms because we were focused on what we were doing to create the negative result. This was not the true cause, but it was helpful  in the short term (if indeed 4.5 years is short term) </p>
            
            <p> We are so compatible and so loving, that just addressing the symptom kept us happy most of our 5 years together. Now, we know the root cause, addressing this will be far more efficient and way more permanent.
                
            <p> The key, as i see it is to recognise when each of us is triggered. When we do we can address exactly that need, or know that we need to stop for now and approach the matter differently </p>
                
            <p> Since we now understand each of our response, this is less likely to trigger us in the future. We understand what is happening, and know it is something the other finds difficult. So we can stop it from escallating.
                
            <p> Like 'fandogh', 'me-time', 'mario', we can put a new measure in place to deal with just that 'trigger or pause'. for example: </p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li> When I feel my fear of inadequacy/insecurity being triggered, I say: khosghgellam, I’m feeling insecure can we stop just now. I need to feel loved and cherished; can you help me feel that first, then we can get back to what we were discussing? </li><br><br>
                    
                    <li> When she feels trapped, pressured suffocated or not in control, she says: Honey jaan, I’m feeling pressured/suffocated. Can you please give me some space. Help me feel free and in control of myself and decision. Then we can get back to this? </li><br>
                
                </ul>
                
            <p> This is only me thinking for now. Imagine how effective we will be when we think together. We will manage this properly once and for all. This doesnt mean we will never get triggered, but it will mean that we will each know how to deal with this and give the other person exactly what they need. It will also mean that we will have the presance of mind to stop when we are both triggered so we can cool down. </p>

            <p> Take this website for example, I made this website (instead of calling/texting) so YOU can freely access. I want to convey information without you feeling pressured. You are completely free not to read it. You are in control here khoshgellam. </p>
            
            <p> I really can't wait to talk about this with you. Because the more we discuss this together, the better our solutions and ability to avoid triggers all together will get. </p>
        
            <p> I love you khosghellam</p>
