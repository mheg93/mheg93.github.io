                <h1> Choice or Persuasion </h1>
                <p> During one conversation, you referenced the way we got together. Was it really your choice? Or did I pressure you, convince you to be with me? Was I right to do it the way I did… </p>   
                <p>I asked myself that question. I knew, right or wrong, that we loved each other, and we had a future.  It was as clear as day to me, but you were determined not to see it. Honestly, we were already dating for months at that point, from my perspective. But, if things were left as they were, we would never move forward. Everything would have stayed as it was and we wouldn’t go anywhere. That’s what I thought at the time</p>

                <h2>Chose and act</h2>
                <p>I decided to act, I took my shot. You were excited for a whole week about what I had planned. I remember us sitting at café Kino and you trying to guess what I had planned. I arranged snowboarding, I cant express how much I enjoyed doing that with you. </p>  

                 <p> You know what happened next. We sat down, we ate, and we talked. In my mind you were in denial. I decided to stand firm and wait. You were afraid of a cage, but this wasn’t a cage. It was an opportunity to have someone in our lives who made it better, who made us more than we could ever be ourselves.  </p>

                 <p> You agreed, I won you may ( a sign from the universe, I thought)  and here we are nearly five years of love, support, happiness, companionship and growth later. Did I convince you or did you choose?</p>

                <h2>Choice or pressure</h2>
                <p>Did I convince you or did you choose?</p>

                <p>If I convinced you, was it the right thing to do or was I wrong to do so? Should I have just let you go or wait forever in the weird place we were in for someone else to get the courage to do what I wouldn’t (and there were many)? </p>

                <p> I thought about this long and hard, especially after you brought it up in the car as something you had considered. Then I remembered a fundamental truth: <br> <br> <em style="font-weight: bolder; color: red;">I have never been able to persuade or pressure you into doing something you don’t want to do…Not once. You are too strong, you always stop me </em></p>
                
                <p>If you don’t want a gift, you will not take it. If you don’t want to go somewhere we will not go. If you don’t want to do something sexual, we won’t do it. If you don’t want to move you wont. Heck, if you don’t want a chocolate bar, you will not touch it.</p>
            
                <p>I learned early on force, trickery, conversation, flattery, nothing gets you to do something you don’t want to do. That is a fact!</p>

                <h2>Day one vs 1613 days </h2>
                <p>I then started thinking about our time together. If I convinced you or pressured you into being with me on day one, what about the other 1,613 days we spent together (I counted). You could have argued, left, distanced yourself at any point. But you always stayed firm.</p>

                <p>Quite the contrary, you worked as much as I did to keep us together. If I brought up something I didn’t like you would make effort to keep us together. If I was unhappy, you cheered me up. If I was distant, you brought me close.</p>
           
                <p>The problem with pressure and persuasion is, it doesn’t last more than the moment we are in. Even if it lasts one day, two, three. It’s not enough for a relationship to survive 4.5 years. It’s not enough to prevent arguments and many attempts at breaking up. </p>

        <div class="event">
            <div class="event-content">
                <h2>Lebenon came and went</h2>
                <p>In fact, I remember  the only time you ever brought this up was 60 days into the relationship in 2019. Did I convince you not to do it? Did I tire you out and persuade you? I remember back then us agreeing, if you still have the same feelings after you go to Lebanon (three months after), then we end it. No fuss, no sadness no drama we tried.</p>
            
                <p> I remember Lebanon came and went. The next year came and went. The pandemic came and went. The move from Marlborough came and went. Not only did we stay together, it never came up again. Not even a hint or a feeling. </p>

        <div class="event">
            <div class="event-content">
                <h2>Loosing freedom</h2>
                <p>I asked you many times if you felt you were losing your freedom throughout our relationship. I asked if you felt less free. You always said no. Whenever you did have bad feelings, I would give you space or backoff.  Whenever you wanted me there but not there, I’d be there and not interact with you. I always managed to give you what you need in that moment, because I try to understand you and because I want you happy every second.  </p>
           
                <p>I then notice that all your concerns are for the future. <em style="color: orange;">Getting resentful IN THE FUTURE. Loosing yourself IN THE FUTURE. Not being able to make decisions IN THE FUTURE. Never about now or in the past </em></p>

                    <p>They are never really regret or anger for the past. Even when we discuss 2019 or how we got together, you are not upset, angry or regretful. You wonder about our future.</p></p>

            <div class="event-content">
                <h2> No regrets </h2>
                <p>I then started reflecting more intensely on your words.  I remember you always saying you were glad you did it, because I asked. Even in the past two weeks you said you never regretted making the decision. Why?</p>
          
                <p>Then I started thinking about what I remember about this past two weeks more deeply more deeply. You said you don’t regret becoming my khosghellam and being together all these years. Why? As long as I have known you, you regret things that happen over which you have no control (from jobs, to work). </p>
          
                <p>Wouldn’t it make sense that you would regret me forcing you to be with me? Me convincing you not to break up? You would wish you had never spent that time with me. You would regret wasting your youth. </p>
            
                <p> But you didn't. All your fears you expressed were about what happens next, all the concerns about what might happen. Whenver you considered the past, there was no bitterness, anger or regret. Quite the opposite. </p>

                <h2>You Chose me</h2>
                <p>The fact is khosghellam, You CHOSE to be with me, to work on our relationship every single second in those 1,613 days. You CHOSE to explore the question of marriage with me. You CHOSE to love me, understand me, accept my love and take my heart. </p>
            
                <p>You didn’t choose this not because I waved a magic wand, or pressured you (how can I if we only discussed it once). You didn’t chose this not because I convinced you or persuaded you (one day of pressure and persuasion is not enough to sustain years). You didn’t chose this because I exhausted you, brain washed you or made you (I have never been able to do that. I cant convince you to do anything you don’t want).</p>
            
                <p> You CHOSE me Sahi. You chose not to stop me and say no when I asked because deep down you knew you wanted to try with me. You chose not to break up when the thought came into your mind because deep down you knew I cherish, love and respect you; I just fell short in that moment.</p>
            
                <p> You chose to continue being with me for all those years, to this very second, because you know, in your bones, I value you, love you, and will do everything in my power to make you happy. That when I fall short, I would leave no stone unturned, I would do my very best to understand you and make any adjustment to make you happy.</p>
