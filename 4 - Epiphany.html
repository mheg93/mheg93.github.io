        <p>Careful consideration and true reflection have led me to the following thoughts. They highlight my realisations and why I believe we can evolve. Become better than we ever could have had we just stayed as we were. </p>
        
        <p>I saw this whole experience as just pain and uncertainty. I now see that it was a blessing. A chance for us to take a real step forward. A step that will set us up towards a truly happy life together. </p>
       
        
       
        <h2>1. Accuracy doesn’t matter, perspective does:</h2>
        <p>
            If one feels something negative, the other should listen to the facts as the person sees them. The purpose is not to correct the story, the facts don’t matter. The purpose is to understand what your partner believes happened. If they believed that’s what happened, then that’s what happened in their mind. This is all that matters, because that’s how you start to get rid of negative feelings and put in positive feelings. How we feel is more important than what is true. 
        </p>


        <h2>2. The heart must be soothed, before the mind can listen: </h2>
        <p>
            We both have things we fear, and actions/words that trigger them. This blinds us to anything else. We act against our interests, we hurt ourselves and each other until this is resolved. We must recognise that in ourselves and each other and learn how to address that in one another. Because until that fear is addressed, it will be our only focus. Our brain becomes programmed to confirm that, and it will become the only thing we see; our only conclusion.It will corrupt whatever else we are doing or talking about. A calm and happy heart is the key to a productive discussion and a positive outcome.
        </p>


        <h2>3. Fear is rarely a good reason to do anything: </h2>
        <p>
            It is important to realise when we are motivated to (AVOID SOMETHING) instead of (ACHIEVE SOMETHING). Wanting to avoid something is not a good reason to do anything. It only leads to the thing we want to avoid, because that is where our energy is going. It makes us rash (my fixation on getting engaged is an example, you were right about. Focusing on something we want to achieve is the only reason we should do something.
        </p>


        <h2>4. Two minds: The fear mind doesn't mean what it says: </h2>
        <p>
           We have more than one brain. A positive brain and a negative brain. The positive one is happy, excited, calm, etc. The negative brain is afraid, jealous, overwhelmed, pressured etc. When we are thinking with our negative mind, our thoughts are also negative. We say things we may be thinking. But they are thoughts that are driven by the negative emotion/s dominating our mind. Just because it’s a thought we have had and considered, doesn’t mean it’s what we believe or truly mean.</li>
        </p>

        <h2>5. Exhausted minds find no solutions, and exhausted mouths say nothing good: </h2>
        <p>
            When a discussion goes too long, we get tired. This expresses itself in different ways. We may lose interest (you) or get fixated/lose the ability to think (me). We lose energy, repeat ourselves and get nowhere good. Keeping discussions light, having fun and taking breaks in the middle are important. They take away pressure and make us more open and creative. </li>
