        <h2>Understanding your suffocation and my insecurity</h2>

        <p> When we spoke in the car. You were my khosghellam was right. It wouldn’t have worked at that point if we just ignored it and moved forward. We didn’t understand what was wrong, how could we address it or prevent it.  </p>

        <p> To address that underlying feeling of pressure/suffocation for you, We need to take steps to recognise when we are each triggered and to address that feeling first regardless of whatever else we are discussing. </p>
        
    </section>

    <section class="strategy-section">
        <h2>Pressure and suffocation</h2>
            <p>Fearing the helplessness of being caged or not being free is a very real thing for you. We must both be more attentive to when that is happening. Then my focus should only be on reminding you, in your heart that you are free and in control.</p>
            
            <p>Your freedom is my priority, and our being together makes you freer. Because it makes you more powerful, more heard, more stable, and more capable. We are equals who want to be here. </p>
            
            <p> Your reaction is immediately to pull away and escape. It doesn’t matter what damage you do to yourself or to me in the process.  When you recognise that is happening, try to remember that there is nothing to escape from, you are here because you want to be. Focus instead on communicating that you starting to are feel that response. My focus then becomes about you.</p>

     <section class="strategy-section">
        <h2>Fear and insecurity</h2>
            <p> Feeling inadequate/insecure can be a very real thing for me and it blinds me. I seek re-assurance of my worth/ability. We must both be attentive when this is the feeling in the drivers seat. </p>
                
            <p> When I feel it inside, I need to communicate that to you more clearly. Then your focus should be on calming that feeling down. I respond best to loving words and a reminder of my worth in your eyes. </p>
            
            <p>Make me feel that my feelings are a priority for you. You love and cherish me. It doesn’t matter if you said it a million times, I really need to hear and feel it in that moment. </p>
            
            <p>My reaction is to lash out, to prove my insecurity/inadequacy wrong. It doesn’t matter what damage I do to you or myself in that moment. I need to learn to back off when I realise this happening. </p>
 </section>



 <section class="strategy-section">
    <h2>Upgrading past methods</h2>
        <p> We have already developed some techniques for dealing indirectly with this (me time, fandogh (pressure in conversation), safe space (a loving space to express), we time (feeling loved).</p>
                
        <p> Being aware of and understanding those fears and needs, means we will be able to spot them earlier and address them directly. This keeps decreasing  the chance of us having another incident like this one. It also means we would be able stop it before it escalates if it ever happens. </p>
</section>


<section class="strategy-section">
    <h2>Triggered at the same time</h2>
        <p> This is something we very rarely experience. The difficulty we had is that we didn’t really understand what was happening before. We only focused on ourselves, and even then, didn’t understand what we were experiencing; or how to stop it. </p>
                
        <p> On both occasions we each surrendered to our most primal response: you pull away, I lash out. You pulling away intensifies my feelings of insecurity and make me feel worthless. My lashing out results means I put a lot of pressure and suffocate. </p>
        
        <p> We create a vicious cycle that keeps getting bigger and bigger until we both snap. When we recognise this is happening, I suggest we pause our discussion all together. A new word “pause”. The argument is no longer important. The priority should be to stop this cycle. </p>
        
        <p> My focus should be on creating an environment you feel in control of, reminding you of your strength and freedom to take away that feeling of suffocation and helplessness. Your focus on saying whatever you have to in that moment to make me feel loved and cherished. </p>
        
        <p> A second component is to give each other space. That space is vital for you to get your mind in order and get out of that frame of mind. But within that space, it would be helpful for me if you also call/text to remind me of what I mean to you, my value to you to make me feel cherished. Feeling cherished is what will calm me and get me out of that frame of mind. </p>
        
        <p> Space alone will increase my stress and anxiety. Reassurance alone will increase yours. We need both. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Understanding when we are each triggered</li><br>
            <li>Step 2: focusing only on de-triggering the other person, through comforting words, space and soothing action </li><br>
            <li>Step 3: Pausing argument when we are both triggered </li><br>
            <li>Step 4: Focusing on what the other person feels happened. It doesn't matter what actually happened, its irrelevant. We take turns to examine each other's reality </li><br>
            <li>Step 5: Never discuss something for too long (we can set a time). Realising when we need to take a fun break to refresh the conversation</li>

        <p> To me, this experience was a blessing because it gave us the opportunity to examine our relationship, highlight things we can do differently and the tools to do it </p>
        
        </p> Difficult times are part of each journey. This was ours, we're in it together and I believe we can overcome it with ease; if you chose that i am worth standing by. </p>
