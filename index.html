            <h2>Welcome khoshgellam</h2>
 <p> I don’t know how much time has passed, maybe you feel it isn’t much, but to me it’s been far too long without my cookie. </p>

<p> I’ve done a lot of thinking during this time. I’ve reflected on past events, discovered my feelings and came to many realisations. </p>

<p> When we spoke the past few times, I didn’t understand what you were trying to say. The truth is, I didn’t even allow myself to listen. </p>

<p> Now, I feel understand why you said what you said, why you had the thoughts you did and most importantly why you felt as you felt. </p>

<p> It’s been a challenge not to call you. I want to share everything with you and frankly I miss you. Hearing your voice and spending time with you makes my day better in everyway; because I truly love you </p>

<p> I want to give you your space though. That’s why I came up with this elegant solution. I created this website, completely from scratch. Amongst other things I wrote the code, came up with the design, and wrote the content.</p>

<p> it gives you complete access to my thoughts, feelings, and findings. But doesn’t pressure, persuade, or exhaust you in anyway. You are free to access it when and if you want. You are also free to read all, some, or none of it.  </p>

<p> I worked very hard on it, but I made many mistakes: Typographical, design, code and thought. Try to overlook that please. I will continue to upload and update to make this better. So there will be new content and changed designs over time. </p>

<p> it’s important to stress that I chose to spend my time this way. I want to give you the option to access my thoughts without violating your space, and I am not expecting anything in return </p>

<p> Feel free to close the browser if you are not interested. But if you chose to explore this website, you will find some very interesting observations. Most importantly, my thoughts on the ‘clash’ you referenced: what it is, where it comes from, how we can eliminate it and why understanding it will make us a much stronger couple by allowing us to satisfy each other’s innermost needs.  </p>

<p> My hope is that this website, the effort I put into understanding, and my willingness to do whatever it takes conveys how important you are to me. Importantly, that your thoughts, feelings and worries are a priority for me; even if sometimes my attitude and words don’t convey that the moment. </p>

<p> In my opinion you were very observant Sahi, and right about alot of things things; even though I didn’t understand at the time. I was only right about two things: 1. We love each other, 2. There is a way forward for us (in each other’s arms) together.  </p>

<p> One final thing. I understand that you like your space and wanted some time. However, this complete lack of contact is painful for me. You are the highlight of my day sahi jan; you have been for 5 years. </p>

<p> If you are willing, I really want us to re-discover one another, heal this rift between us, and work on evolving our relationship together; to take it to the next level. </p>

<p> I miss you Sahi. I won’t call unless something comes up because I want to respect your space and the word I gave you to the best of my ability. However, If you miss me as much as I’m missing you and you want to hear my voice, nothing would make me happier than to receive a call from you </p>

            <h2> Website Structure</h2>   

                <p> This website is divided into three sections: Memory, Insight, and Evolving. </p>

                    <li> <em>Evolving:</em> A deep examination of how we got together and how we stayed together, an appreciation of the opportunity we have to truly evolve and how we can do so, and a love letter from me to you khoshgellam.

            <h2> From the heart</h2>

            <p> I really hope if nothing else. Even if you disagree with every word. My sincerity reaches you. </p>
            
            <p> I hope you look at this: the website, my introspection and my analysis; and see that even if i don't have the answer; i will do everything and anything to find it; Because i truly love you. </p>

            <p> When we sat on those steps, you maybe had a point. We couldn't have gone any further without truly understanding the 'clash' you refer to and addressing it at the root. 
                
            <p> In my opinion it's clash but not of our personality, and the secret to addressing it is to recognise when a very specific fear we each have is triggered. I explain more in the 2023 chapter. </p>

            <p> I offer you hope, a solution, and most importantly my heart. </p>

            <p> It's a valuable heart, alot of phenomenal people have worked very hard and sacrificed alot to make it what it is. </p>

            <p> It is my heart that makes me who i am, that has everything of value in myself. It's also what makes me do my very best to make you feel loved, cherished, happy, understood, supported and safe. </p>
                
            <p> I may not always go about it the right way, and I may fall short at times. But I will find the way, because i love you and will do my absolute best every second we are together. </p>

            <p> It's my heart that makes me your momo jaan </p>
 
           <p> I hope that, you see the value in my heart over the disappointment of my shortcomings </p>

            <p> My heart is yours khosghellam, don't doubt it; it will create magic and it wont let you down. I promise. </p>
