            <h2>Welcome khoshgellam</h2>
            <p> I designed this website (from scratch) just for you. I have spent the last week remembering, researching and reflecting.</p> 
                
               <p> I have realised many things I was blind to when we last spoke. You were right about so much, in truth, after some serious reflection i now only think i have been ever truly right about one thing </p>

               <p> I can't tell you how hard it's been for me to resist the impulse to just call and eagrly tell you everything. But not telling you would mean you not sharing my epiphanies; dilemma.  </p>

               <p> Then I came up with a brilliant idea (you will understand why, if you chose to keep reading). I'm going to build a website, just for you. So you can access it only when you want to; on your terms. No pressure. </p>

               <p> I have had a secret khoshgellam, over the past three months, I've been studying fullstack engineering in my spare time. It's how i learned how to do all this. I wanted to surprise you, and thought why not try to impress you in the process. Pretty cool huh.</p>

            <h2> Website Structure</h2>   

                <p> This website is divided into three sections: Remembering, reflecting, realising, and the next chapter. </p>

                    <li><em>Reflecting: </em> My memory of the past few weeks, my feelings throughout, enlightening conversations and key takeaways </li>

                    <li> <em>Evolving:</em> A deep examination of how we got together and how we stayed together, an appreciation of the opportunity we have to truly evolve and how we can do so, and a love letter from me to you khoshgellam.

            <h2> From the heart</h2>

                <p> I really hope you read everything, i really hope you give me that chance. I put alot of thought into every word, really thought it through and genuinely think I understand what you were trying to express; though that is for you to decide</p>
                
                <p> With that said, it really is up to you, whether you want to read it. That's why i made it into a website, you are in control khoshgellam. Free to do what you will without any pressure. </p>

                <p> As ever khoshgellam, you have dominated my mind and heart. I really miss you more than I can express and hope you will call me soon (alot of space hurts me), but it really is up to you. You are in the driver seat khosghelalm</p>
