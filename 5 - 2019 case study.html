      My Facts:
        </blockquote>

        <p> I was going through a very difficult personal time because I had just been notified of my grandmother’s diagnosis. I needed help and support. I wanted to feel re-assured and safe. Love makes me feel safe I didn’t tell my partner this explicitly, and hoped she would do this instinctively in response to my reaching out. </p>

        <p> My partner chose that moment to go to the cinema with someone, I knew wanted to date her. He didn’t know we were together at the time, because it would have harmed my partner’s job. She intentionally decided to assert her freedom in that moment. </p>

        <p> She didn’t care if I felt jealous or if I was feeling unloved. She couldn’t see beyond herself. All that mattered to her was what she was feeling. Reading those facts one would think, does this girl even love him, does she care and value him as he does her? Of course not. </p>

        <p> My immediate instinct: She doesn’t love me, she doesn’t cherish me.</p> 

    
        <aside class="sidebar-note">
        Her Facts:
        </aside>
        <p>
            <p> We had been spending a lot of time together up until that point. I was dominating her schedule. I was there every evening, every morning. We were constantly out together. The weekends she used to meet with others and organise her days were long gone. This was arguably the first activity she had arranged that did not have anything to do with me in a long time. </p>

            <p> Everywhere she looked I was there. Finally, an opportunity to have a day outside, what had started to feel like a prison. Exactly what she feared being in all along. She had to get outside. She was suffocating. </p>
    
            <p> To her my attempts to reach out by itself triggered her suffocation response. “I need you here with me now please” I was signalling. “He wants to cage me next to him until I drown” is what she hears. </p>
    
            <p> She must make a stand. Signal this is unacceptable. She is free to spend time with others, free to do things without me, free to have some alone time. She doesn’t realise all this at the time. All she feels is suffocation from my constant presence, and pressure from my reaching out. </p>
    
            <p> Like a caged tiger, her immediate and only instinct: ESCAPE! </p>
        </p>


        <aside class="mistake">
            We Fucked up
            </aside>
            <p> Neither of us could explain our true feelings or thoughts to the other. All she knows is she feels pressure, suffocation, a danger to her very sense of self. All I feel is sadness, insecurity, a danger to my very sense of worth. </p>
        
            <p> We both forgot why we got together. We forget the joy, safety, companionship and strength we found through our union. We forget the love and commitment to that love which kept us strong.  </p>
            
            <p> (Unrelated Note: her fear/pressure brain (more on that later) may think we got together because I pressured her. But that overlooks one simple and consistent fact: I do not have the ability to pressure or convince her into doing something she doesn’t want to do, no matter what I do. </p>
            
            <p> Her reaction to pressure is to resist. I couldn’t do ever do it, even with something as simple as accepting a chocolate bar. She will make it a point to refuse, wait forever if she must. The only reason she got together with me is because deep down, she wanted it. </p>
            
            <p> The reason we stayed together all that time is because she wanted to be with me, she felt happy, cherished, and supported. She felt deep down my love and respect, she also realised she liked it. She liked who she was becoming. It’s the only reason she would even consider marriage later. </p>
            
            <p> Even she would later say, she never regretted it. I believe she never even considered it in that light until I brought it up to her fear brain in five guys. She was glad we did it. That itself tells me she valued my strength and daring that day. I hope (many years into the future as we are together and lying next to each other) we look at it as one of the best decisions we had ever made. </p>
            
            <p> However, like I said earlier. Facts don’t matter if this is what she feels in this moment. Then despite the result, it’s a feeling I will do everything to make sure she doesn’t feel that way again. </p>
            
            <p> To achieve that we need to discuss how we take big scary steps my khoshgellam is nervous about. My khosghgellam fears change. She finds comfort in stability. Understanding some of her fears in the way I have explained makes me realise the more relaxed she is, the surer of the next step, the more in control she feels. </p>
            
            <p> Think of a car, the more in control she is, the easier it is to make the turn or take the scary step. The trick is to also for her to be mindful of her fears (which I wasn’t, with the marriage discussion) so the car whilst controlled, doesn’t stop.) </p>
        
        
            <aside class="solved">
            We solved it?
                </aside>
                <p> Her words are in my mind “pressured” “suffocated”. I try to understand what I could have done for her to feel that. This question, I now realise, was only half of what I needed to ask. So, it gave part of the answer; how to deal with the symptom.  </p>
        
                <p> Nevertheless, I think. One particularly interesting conversation with a taxi driver gives me my breakthrough. I get excited when I feel I understand. I rush to her place, I explain my finding. She is constantly around me, this suffocates her, she:
                <em> *** She routinely needs time scheduled time away from me*** </em></p>
            
             <p>Let us break that down: </p>
           
             <ul>
                <li> Routinely, because it must be constant throughout our relationship. It’s similar to eating, drinking or sleeping. </li> <br><br>
                
                <li> Scheduled, because she must use that time to make plans of her own. My khosghellam finds comfort in routine. </li> <br><br>
                
                <li> Time away from me, because although she loves me and thinks of me as her best friend. Although she finds comfort and strength in my presence (sometimes just asking me to stay in the room without saying anything). Time where I’m not around is equally important, a break to digest and turn her attention to herself. </li> <br><br>
                
                <li> We set aside Sundays (no me days) and another day. I also start not to be around her as much. This doesn’t bother me at all so long as we are in a good and happy place. It also helps if there is some kind of contact when that happens (she understands that herself, and starts calling me at the end of the day, just to tell me good night and she loves me, one of the many little things she did to carry me, just as I did her). </li> <br><br>
            </ul>


            <aside class="result">
             The Result
                </aside>
                <p> It works like a charm. Anytime she needed time off from me, she would tell me. I would disappear. Anytime she failed to tell me, I would notice, and make myself disappear. She would spend more time with her friends, and I would encourage her to do so. </p>  

                <p> She felt more free and in turn became more caring and attentive to my need to be loved, cherished and reassured (though I didn’t fully understand my need and fear at that point). She implemented her own solutions to my problems in response to the thoughts I would express. </p>
        
                <p> She would constantly hug or kiss me when I needed it. She would sooth me with sexual contact and became very good at detecting when I wanted to play, and when it was *feeding time. Though, we both didn’t yet understand it in the way I explain it now. </p>
        
                <p> It worked like a charm for 4.4 long and happy years. </p>
