    <div class="section" id="beginning">
        <h1> Stress </h1>   
         <p> I can’t breathe. The stress I had experienced this month was already unreal; unlike any I can remember. My uncle’s diagnosis terrified me to my core taking me back 4 years to a similar call I received concerning my grandmother. My father’s recent situation coupled with the severe physical and psychological reaction he had following the news crippled me. </p>

            <p> A severe family argument made me wonder if what my khoshgellam said about families drifting apart applies to my family after all. Getting rejected from pupillage and an upcoming job made me afraid of how her family would perceive me. The stress of deciding on my next step, knowing it was pivotal to my career weighed on me. </p>
            
            <p> Most importantly, the prospect of us moving away from each other worried me, as did the move itself because I was alone and having no luck finding a house so far. Wherever I looked, stress and pressure. Throughout this all, a very real fear that (I thought) started brewing in my mind, but that had been there for some time; Does she love me? Does she want me? </p>
            
            <p>I am quiet, not because I want to be, but because I can’t speak. Pressure and fear are eating me up inside. I need her. I try to reach out, but it’s not coming out right. I want her support, her help… I want to breathe. </p>
            
            <p> Instead of asking for the help I really need in that moment, I try to soothe my heart. I ask her, I insist, I don’t stop. I just want to hear that I am loved, to be reminded she chose me (! I shall elaborate later). </p>
            
            <p> The result, I am sat on some stairs listening to the love of my life. The person I am convinced deep down is the one, the one who I turn to for support say she is thinking about ending our union. That after thinking about it, she may not want me after all. It was like being pushed off a building. A more difficult month than I could have ever imagined. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="adventures">
        <h1 id="pain">pain</h1>
        <p> Hearing her say she doesn’t think “this would work” broke me in a way I never imagined. Feeling her start to lose trust in our future brought me more pain than I could have prepared myself for: emotional, psychological, and even physical (palpitations hurt). </p>
        
        <p> A sleepless night and devastating conversations, all I can think about throughout was what she said, “I feel pressured…suffocated”, “You are a good debater and have a persuasive quality, that should be left at work” and “If we continue all I wonder if I will disappear and be swallowed by resentment”. </p>
        
        <p> It has been a very long 6 days. I have had three objectives throughout. To understand: (1) My khoshgellam, (2) My relationship with fear, and (3) The impact it has had on us both throughout our amazing relationship. </p>
       
        <p> During this period, I’ve done some serious thinking and intensive research. I’ve attended multiple group therapy sessions, spoken with psychologists, asked friends for advice and listened to lectures. I really did want to go outside my perspective, to understand my khoshgellam. </p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="promise">
        <h1>College green</h1>
        
            <p>With one exception, everyone advises me not to call. I pace in front of the petrol station under her house for an hour. If I leave it like this, I will lose her. We will lose each other. I don’t want that. I know in my heart, it would be terrible mistake, a devastating mistake for us both, something that would change our lives in a catastrophic way. </p>

            <p>I finally gather my courage, print out my favourite pictures and dial her number. She answers and agrees to come out, I’m overjoyed. Just the prospect of spending time with he has that effect on me. We walk to a nearby park bench. I tell her my discovery, what I think her thoughts are. As I speak with her, I remember one of the reasons I love her so much; she’s my favourite person to talk to. </p>

            <p> She agrees with my analysis. I understand the problem, I was so relieved I stopped listening. I tell her it’s easy to fix, we’ve done it many times before after all. She disagrees, I feel I’m in free fall. Why can’t we fix it I think and ask? What made you decide this I ask calmly though I am panicking in my mind. Her answer, this was exactly the topic of our first and only major incident. In her mind, if we couldn’t fix it then, we won’t fix it now and it will keep happening. </p>

            <p>I am so scared of what will happen next, I rush to correct her facts (more on that later). I remind her that incident took place very shortly after my grandmother was diagnosed and I was extremely stressed. She doesn’t think this is why that happened. I get more frustrated. her facts are just wrong. I was wrong in more ways than one, but more on that later. </p>

            <p>However, after our discussion, she thinks about it again. We agree to stay together but take a break to calm our minds and think clearly. It’s not what I wanted; I wanted this over, behind us, to have us back into one another’s arms comforting each other about this terrible misunderstanding. One less thing to worry about. </p>

            <p>I didn’t notice her stress; I didn’t notice how badly she needed space. All I could think of was my own. We are different in that respect. While this break might calm her stress, it would multiply mine. I have no choice, so I accept. </p>

    </div>


    <div class="section" id="party">
        <h1>The party</h1>
            <p>5 days later, we see each other for the first time at our friends going away party. We have fun, she gets drunk, and I relax. It’s the first relaxed evening we have in a very long time. We are not discussing engagement, parents, or anything else. </p>

            <p>I take care of her the entire evening. I’m so attuned to her, I water her when she is thirsty, air her when she is dizzy, sit her when she is agitated. She is so attuned to me she stays close throughout the evening; we dance together, we have fun. Then we go to the bathroom. </p>
            
            <p>I buy her a lollipop; she drunkenly looks me in the eye smiles that smile (with a little hmm hmmm) that makes my heart melt and kisses me. A true kiss. She loves me, I feel it in my bones for the first time since the stress took over my heart. In that moment it was just me and her, and the true genuine love that kept us together for many years. </p>
            
            <p>I walk her home, we sit in the reception and wait for her to sober up. We talk. I tell her the truth of how much I love her and how she is in every future I imagine. . She looks at me sadly and says “maybe you should start thinking differently”.  My heart shatters, pain. </p>
            
            <p>I look her in the eyes, and see something else though, sadness. It’s not what she wants. I ask her why she is sad. The flood gates open “of course I love you and I want you” she says, I’m just not sure we know enough to get married yet.  She continues “this past week I’ve been sad, and I miss you a lot”. And she continues to tell me about the “pressure/suffocation” she felt and her worries that it would come back. </p>
            
            <p>It's too much, I break down completely. A crack A crack opens, and some of the pressure I had built up starts to escape; only a little, but it’s enough. I reach her, she finally starts to see a little of what I have kept hidden under the surface. </p>
            
            <p>She hugs me, puts her hand only heart and tries to calm me. She tells me she loves me again. I say let’s end this break and find our way back to each other. She is conflicted but looks at me and silently nods, I’m overjoyed, but I can tell, she is not convinced the problem is resolved. </p>
            
            <p>A few moments of us just hugging and she sleeps on my shoulder, I gently get her to her feet, and she keeps saying one word “gazelle”. I’m bemused, I laugh and guide her to the door. She goes in and I go home. I finally feel some hope, this might to be ok after all. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="ring">
        <h1>The ring</h1>
            <p>I wake up with a sudden realisation. I tried to model my pursuit of my khoshgellam on the way my parents got married. That was a different time, different circumstances and they are different people. Moreover, I never asked her to marry me. </p>

            <p>I get excited, after the day before I want to do something special. Something to help us put this all behind us. My plan was simple. I would buy a ring, get down on a knee, propose let her hold the ring, then take it back. I would keep it until we do it properly with her family when the time is right, I no longer cared when I just wanted to ease my fear hear her say I am hers and she is mine. It was meant to be just a special private moment between the two of us. </p>
            
            <p>I book a car and drive her to the beach. I’m overjoyed she agrees to come with me. We can’t get to the beach, but the universe provides a pub under a beautiful moon. Then we are sat at a small wooden table enjoying her favourite drink (tea) in the moon light. She is enjoying the tea but looked wary. </p>
            
            <p>I knew from the words we had exchanged earlier, that she had completely forgot everything we discussed before. She forgot we would find our way back to each other. It was like an episode of “big-bang-theory” or “friends”. Ironic, somewhat funny, and to me just terrifying. </p>
            
            <p>Again, she explains that she doesn’t know if it will work. I find out she would make it work if she could, she loves me, she just thinks there is an issue that runs deep and cannot be fixed. The best we would do is mask it and wait for it to happen again. </p>
            
            <p>I remind her it’s only the second incident we have. She tries to explain it’s about the intensity. Even though most of our time is happy, this is a recurring problem. One that we never fixed. I can’t hear her; the conversation is not going as I planned. </p>
            
            <p>I start doing what she had already expressed not liking. I try to win the argument. When she says this is a big issue, I dismiss her comments. I don’t know what else to do. I want her to see what I did; this was an easy fix. I realise now, that I was blind. I was doing exactly what made her feel this was such an unfixable issue. </p>
            
            <p>What else can I do, I thought. If I do nothing, I prove her wrong, but we lose each other. If I debate and try to convince her to give it a shot, I prove her right and she might give me up as a result. I’m in a no-win situation. I didn’t see the third way, I see now (more on that later). </p>
            
            <p>Suddenly, she starts breaking. She explains how much stress she is going through herself. Her uncle is ill, her cousin had a heart attack, her parents are a mess, she is concerned for their health. I’m not the only one under pressure she says, pain and stress in her eyes. </p>
            
            <p>I’m shocked, I didn’t know. But in that instant, I realised a truth. We both needed comfort from the other. We both needed the other to be understanding and soothe us (her through assurance, me through kindness and space). We both needed the other, but we were both to focused on ourselves. </p>
            
            <p>I still did not see the larger point, she grasped with just her intuition and reflection. </p>
            
            <p>Then I do something stupid. I get out the ring, go round the car, get down on one knee and ask her to marry me. She is stunned, I grow embarrassed. Hadn’t she just told me she wasn’t sure it would work. I imagined this would be our story, she would look at the white/gold ring I chose just for her. she would smile and reassure me somehow; even if she doesn’t say yes on the spot, we’d be back on track. </p>
            
            <p>I could have never been so wrong. She is shaken, she asks the question she always asks when I do something she finds adorable and stupid “what do I do with you”. My knees start to hurt, I get into the car. “I wish you had waited a little, why couldn’t you wait?”, she silently shuts the box. I don’t notice. I replay what she just said “I wish you had waited a little”. She wasn’t saying no. She did want to be with me, what’s more she thought time would help. </p>
            
            <p>Momentary clarity did nothing to ease my hurt, my embarrassment. In my mind I took a genuine risk. She misunderstood. I wasn’t trying to go behind her family’s back, I just wanted to make her feel special. To know in her heart what she meant to me. Unfortunately, I wasn’t doing the thing she wanted, hearing her. </p>

    <div class="section" id="shame">
        <h1>Shame</h1>
        <p> Hearing her say she doesn’t think “this would work” broke me in a way I never imagined. Feeling her start to lose trust in our future brought me more pain than I could have prepared myself for: emotional, psychological, and even physical (palpitations hurt). </p>

        <p>I get frustrated and didn’t notice my voice raising. Then I see something I had only seen in her once before (at least when looking at me), fear. “I’m not feeling comfortable” I’m shocked. I’m angry, how can she be afraid of me? What does she think I shall do? Doesn’t she understand that she is my love?</p>
        
        <p>My mind starts taking over, she is not feeling safe. I feel shame, frustration, annoyance, fear all at once. I take her home. On the drive I ask her to do something “why am I the only one reaching out” I say things I don’t believe “I’m the only one carrying our relationship” “things to the effect of “I’m the one who shows he cares” “I suspected you don’t love me” things that are just not true. </p>

    </div>


    <div class="section" id="sleepless">
        <h1> A sleepless night </h1>
            <p>That night I’m back in my head once more. I cannot believe that something so good, that has been the highlight of my life for 5 years, can crumble in two weeks over a misunderstanding. Something in me is convinced she is it. </p>
            
            <p>There are many unanswered questions: where will we live? When will we have a family? What if we can’t have kids? What if our careers require us to live in separate places? How will we build wealth? Where will we spend our golden years? However, I have this deep belief we will resolve these questions together one at a time. Though she was eager to do so at a time where I wanted to know she loved me, she wanted me, I was her choice. </p>
            
            <p>As I think over a sleepless night, I have a thought I didn’t want to consider; what if she is right? I look inwards, and then an epiphany: What if we are both right? What if we are exactly right for each other, but it won’t work as it is now? </p>
            
            <p>What if fixing something was entirely the wrong approach. What if instead, we needed to gain some perspective. In my heart, for the first time I felt I was on the right track. I needed time to work this out, to calm my emotions we both needed time. My voice of reason, who suggested this in the first place was right about needing some space. </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section" id="facetime">
        <h1> Facetime </h1>
            <p>I call her the day after, but she refuses to come out. She asks me to speak on the phone. I want to show her that I respect her wants. She looks fed up and tired. She wants to spend time with her parents and ease their burdens. </p>
                
            <p>I suggest we take some space. She, in an exasperated voice said that’s what she wanted to do in the first place to calm down. I agree. We set a date of two months, for her to call me on the 22nd of October. I am however, not sure I can make it to that date, I shall explain why later. I finally ask if we are still together. She pauses. ‘yes’ she says ‘we are together but just taking some space’. </p>
            
            <p>Though I am filled with uncertainty. I have a very strong feeling that this is not the end. This is just the beginning. This is our big moment, and we will find our way back to each other. Because we want to, coming out with me, agreeing to stay together its her way of reaching out. </p>
</div>



    <div class="section" id="closing">
        <h1> Closing thoughts </h1>
            <p>If I want her back truly, if she wants me back, we need to take the next step in our relationship. I thought that step was getting engaged, introducing our parents to one another. Perhaps I was wrong.  Am I the one rushing, is she the one dragging? Or are we both wrong? I don’t know. </p>

            <p>But one thing I do know and have started to suspect. I’m wrong about so many things. However, one thing is clear. We love each other and we want to find a reason for it to work. It may not be enough on its own, but it is a start. I will listen to what else we need, if we don’t have it, we will find it together. </p>
