            <h1> My dearest khosghellam,</h1>
            <p class="salutation">Sahi jaan, my love: </p>
            <p> I finally understand and know you feel khoshgellam. I’ve thought about nothing else. I’ve truly tried to see it from her perspective and to understand her fears and concerns. </p>

            <p> You were right about many things. </p>
            
            <p> This isn’t about ‘fixing’ something. Nothing is really broken. We njust ever fully dealt with the root cause of the issue we faced, we handled the symptoms. </p>
            
            <p> Has this been present throughout our entire relationship, maybe. But if we truly examine this, it means that we managed it instinctively many long years. We are so compatible, love each other so truly, care so completely it rarely manifested; despite never truly identified...until now</p>
            
            <h3> This time, we were not equipped to handle it yet:</h3>

            <p> We completely mishandled the situation. We acted poorly and made everything worse, because we didn't understand the issue or where it comes from. </p> 
            
            <p> Both of us being under so much stress and unintentionally magnifying each other’s fears was a receipie for disaster. Add our famlies to this as well as the pressure of trying to involve them in our relationship during a house move was too much to handle at that time. We reacted poorly. </p>
            
            <h3> It is not a personality clash, it's a trigger reaction</h3>
            <p> A personality clash, a recurring fundamental issue would manifest in our day to day life all the time. We would constantly be fighting, constantly feeling bad (afraid, caged, etc..) we wouldn’t want to be near each other at all. That’s what the professionals think. </p>
            
            <p> This however, understanding each other’s needs and fears on a deeper level. Equips us to truly deal with this. Really prevent it from happening, and when triggered to stop it from escalating quickly. </p>
            
            <p> I read this quote, I liked: “Darkness lies in dwelling on the past and fearing the future.” </p>
            
            
            <h3> We are not perfect, but we are perfect for each other. </h3>
            
            <p> I'm told by those who love me, that my greatest gift is my heart. It is passionate, loyal, compassionate and dedicated </p>

            <p> It may not be much and it may not be enough, I don't know. But I offer you my heart </p>

            <p> In me you have someone who truly values you, puts your needs first, encourages your freedom, independance and career </p>

            <p> In me you will find someone who respects your culture, your family and the things you value. Someone who tries to learn about your language and heritage so you always feel at home</p>

            <p> I am a flawed person, and I will not succeed everytime. I will fail many times; this time i failed. But I will always use every last breath to find my way back to you so we can move forward together</p>

            <p> My heart is yours, and with it everything else I have </p>

              
            <p> My promise is to always make you feel loved, cherished, respected, and to help you evolve to be the best person you can ever be </p>

        <h2> I love you with all my heart. </h2>
