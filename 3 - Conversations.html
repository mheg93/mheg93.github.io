        <h2> Conversation with a psychologist</h2>
            <p>  I had a very long conversation with a friend, an aspiring therapist. I unburdened myself during the conversation. he had many insights throughout our conversation. Most interesting of which, is his remark that I am not in touch with my emotions. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Every question he asked is answered with a thought, he stops the conversation “but what did you feel?” he would ask. I got more and more frustrated. I just told you. “No that’s not an emotion, that’s a thought… that’s a remark…that’s not a feeling”. Finally frustrated, I say I am hurt, I am in pain. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I proudly brag about my ability to manage stress. I explain that I have been very productive. Indeed, I had said as much to my partner: I acquired four certificates, am working on computer coding skills, whilst managing a heavy case workload, applying for jobs, training for job interviews on a formal course (so I don’t miss the next opportunity), and looking for houses. </p>
            <br>
            <p>He is unimpressed. This is what we call “avoidance (a fancier term to be honest)”. “You are not managing your stress; you are avoiding it by keeping your mind so busy you won’t process it”. You are making yourself focus, so you don’t have to manage or feel it. That’s bad, you’re a pressure cooker. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I pause, that’s the first time I was told both these remarks. A glimmer of truth escapes. Tearfully, though he can’t see it over the phone; I say, “I feel I am going to drown”.  That is the truth. Since the end of June, this is exactly what I have felt. </p>

        <h2> Conversation with a friend </h2>
            <p>I speak to my bubbly American friend, a married mother of three with a borderline delusional sense of certainty. I wanted a feminine perspective. She patiently listened. She then asked me a strange question “what does your deathbed look like”. Bizarre American question I thought. </p>
            <br>
            <p>She explained that she knows what I want my death to look like “big house I built in the middle of nowhere, a big family around me”. Every decision I make is to take me there. For example, ‘I want a very big family, which means I need to have kids early. That’s why I’m on number three’. I want to live in America, that’s why I picked a husband who wants to live there. I want to be a housewife, so I picked a husband who is ok with that. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In her view, by not answering any questions and instead insisting on getting an answer to the love/want question (more on that later) made it difficult for her to assess the compatibility of our life goals; especially in light of her new job. </p>
            <br>
            <p>She asked me what I want out of life. I explained, I’m not sure exactly. She advised me to look within myself. Who am I? what do I want? </p>
            <br>
            <p>That is a difficult question for me to answer. I don’t know what I want. I see things from the perspective of others. But sometimes I struggle to know my perspective. I’m very observant of the feelings of others but struggle to identify my own. I am very discerning of the motivations of those around me, but it’s the single most difficult question for me to answer. </p>

        <h2> Conversation with a therapist </h2>
            <p>I attend a group therapy session. I wanted to explore my sadness. I found myself in a group of very confused and distressed men. </p>
            <br>
            <p>One caught my attention. He was fat, pasty white with short straw-coloured hair, and a meek demeanour. He explained that his girlfriend had given him an ultimatum. “You don’t call me, I call you. I don’t know when, so you will just have to wait” “I can barely carry my own emotions, and you are dragging me down”. </p>
            <br>
            <p> How pathetic I thought? Why pine after such a person. Who obviously, from the stories, doesn’t care about him and treats him with no respect. He cries as he speaks, saying he just wishes she would come back and was going to do anything. Why would someone want to be with a person who doesn’t value them. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Then I realised, this is not me. why would she be with me all this time if she didn’t want to be? </p>
            <br>
            <p>When we spoke in the car, she started to wonder if that’s because I was constantly around her. But that was our fear talking (more on that point later). When I reflect, this two years we had spent a lot of time apart (Egypt twice, parents twice, a lot of me time, Scotland). We were constantly away from one another and without much contact throughout. However, we always chose to return to each other. Always, we missed each other and made time for the other. Looked forward to that time. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Isn’t it more likely that she felt happy, cherished, loved and respected around me? Isn’t it more probable she wanted me because she knew I’m hers, understand her, respect her needs and do what I can to make her feel happy. </p>
            <br>
            <p>That is my guess, and what I learned. </p>

    <div class="info-section" id="ozj">
        <h2> Conversation with an Ozj </h2>
   
            <p> I speak with a mutual friend. She is the only person who has heard the story from my partner’s side. I decide to open to her, I’m tired but I’m making progress. I tell her everything but stay away from what I think my partner would rather keep private. </p>
            <br>
            <p> She is initially sympathetic. Looking to make sure I’m OK. She is being a good friend. But the more I explain, the more her expression turns hopeful. “I don’t think either of you is thinking right at moment” “she loves you more than you know, this isn’t what she want”. </p>
            <br> 
            <p> After listening to me, she thinks and says. A big part of this is cultural and family difference. One major point for me, something that had upset me greatly. </p>
            <br>
            <p> I didn’t see the effort she was doing behind the scenes, I just knew how I felt and in my mind that feeling was ignored. My fear mind started whispering “they don’t like you”, “she doesn’t really like you”, “whenever it gets serious, she doesn’t do anything, because she doesn’t really want you”. I don’t notice the precious ghorme-sabzi, she shares with me. Her parent’s invitation for that one lunch, the kindness with which they treat me. </p>
            <br>
            <p> I compare it with how open my family has been with her, and it in my mind is not even close. She has a relationship with my parents, has lived in my house for two days, is always invited. I am not treated the same, I think. I’m kept away and cant get to know them. They will leave soon, and the chance will be gone again for a year. Do we then repeat this pattern the year after and the one after that?  In my moments of sadness, I think “she must not really want me in her real life”. </p>
            <br>
            <p> My friend sees it differently. “why would you meet parents, you are not married’ she asks. I explain that in my culture, the way my parents and friends did it. Both are constantly invited to the house of their in-laws. They have meals together, spend time together and build a bon leading up to the engagement. Because in my culture, you are becoming part of the family, and the family is inviting you to become that. </p>
            <br>
            <p> My friend is confused. “we would not do that”, the family would trust their daughter and the husband would trust their partner. Only after they become married do they get to spend time together. Any other way is disrespectful. </p>
            <br>
            <p> I remember my partner in trying to explain something similar at one point. But I never fully explained the cultural background and my fear was active. I was hurt. She apologised multiple times for my feeling the way I did after her parents came the first time. But she didn’t quite know how to address my feelings of being hurt, and I could not explain it to her. </p>
            <br>
            <p> I felt her focus was “I didn’t do anything wrong, we have always treated you well. I’m sorry you feel that way but stop attacking my family and me”. My focus was “you are not helping me to take the next step, you must not love or want me”. We were more interested in defending ourselves then taking away each other’s hurt. (More on that later*).</p>
            <br>
            <p> My friend thinks we both felt bad about this because we didn’t understand each other. I now realise, that I was afraid, and my mind was looking for anything to confirm that fear. Which is why I reacting the way I did. Meanwhile my partner started feeling pushed, which is why she reacted the way she did. </p>
            <br>
            <p> You are missing a bigger point, my friend then tells me as we move on. </p>
            <br>
            <p> She is uncertain about the future in her heart (something I know). “You are talking to her brain not her heart”. The brain can’t hear if the heart is not listening. She further explains. “I know impossible to be certain” but you are not giving her anything at all to start feeling stable. “You need a place to start, then you start to adapt”. </p>
            <br>
            <p> In my friend’s mind, we are both wrong. One can’t plan out their whole life or be sure of all their next steps. Many uncertainties interfere with those plans (someone falls ill, money is lost, job opportunity, someone fired, early pregnancy, late pregnancy), she agrees we deal with them and adapt. However, one can’t start without any clue of their direction or an idea of how they intend to start building the foundation to their lives together. We need a starting point, that starting point are some basic decisions about finances, location, and a general timeline to start. </p>
            <br>
            <p> We both got focused on ourselves in that moment. as she was struggling with the fear of uncertainty, I was struggling with fears of inadequacy. We both feared uncertainty, though of different things. Her of our future, me of her commitment. I’m getting closer I thought. </p>
            <br>
            <p> At some point, my friend asked me if I propose with ring, or did I surprise her with this marriage talk. I explained we do it family to family (I don’t tell her I did try the ring, that turned out great Afterall). </p>
            <br>
            <p> We had agreed our parents would meet beforehand, but never discussed the specifics. It was one of the reasons, I got triggered later. But I see the truth now. I started getting afraid she didn’t want me anymore, she started feeling pushed when I asked her to confirm. (That is the key, will discuss in depth later on). </p>
            <br>
            <p> My view going into this, Is that you pick the person then deal with the practicalities. Maybe that is half right. My partners view as I understood it, is you cant decide one without the other. </p>
            <br>
            <p> I think the more accurate view is you pick the partner and come to some basic decisions on the start of the life you want. Once the decision is made, there is an understanding that you commit to each other and face challenges and uncertainties together. </p>

        <h2> Conversation in group therapy </h2>
            <p>I attend a group therapy session on healing rifts in relationships. This session was more interesting. I told the therapist running the session. I’m a courtroom advocate, debating is my profession. I set out facts, put forward my case and persuade the person in front of me. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I asked, “my partner and I disagree about the facts from which her negative emotions stem” I approach this by setting out the facts, gently telling her she is wrong just so we are on the same foot? Then I explain these bothers her and says she doesn’t like me persuading her. But if I do nothing, I prove her wrong the relationship ends. If I do something, I prove her right and she decides that’s why the relationship ends. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The therapist laughed. She needs to want the relationship not to end, she says. You are going against each other. What you are describing is conflict. I explain that’s not it at all, I want us to resolve the matter. She disagrees. If one of you is wrong, you both loose she says. </p>
            <br>
            <p>She gives me another hint, someone wins, and someone loses. Approaching things in that way means no one wins and we both lose. Her questions reveal that when I get defensive, I’m too busy planning my next move and don’t truly listen. I’m dismissive. She needs to feel heard and so do I. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Falling into the frame of mind we sometimes fall into means that she is not heard, and I’m not actually sharing what is in my heart. Its never about the issue itself, its about the conversation. <p>
            <br>
            <p>I learned a lot from that session. </p>
