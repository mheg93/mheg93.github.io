        <h2>Fandogh</h2>
        <p> The safe word ‘fandogh’ was designed because you get tired in long conversations. </p>
            
        <p> What I didn’t realise is that long conversations that are serious can be a lot of pressure on you, if you are afraid you will agree to something because you are tired. The longer it is, the worse it is. I understand that now, because I am considering what I believe to be your trigger point. </p>
        
        <p> Of course, this raises a question, what about when you are being stubborn with a decision that you can’t take back? Something for us to discuss perhaps. </p>
        
        <p> However, I never realised the effect a long discussion has on me. I’ve always thought I have a lot of stamina. But the reality is there is a negative impact on me to. I get fixated. I lose the ability to resolve whatever It was I am discussing. In a way, even though I think I’m making my point, only keep repeating myself. </p>
        
        <p> This is great for a court room, terrible for actual problem solving, because we lose the creativity and positivity that is necessary to discover a new way or notice something we never thought of. </p>
        
        <p> Talking should never be a competition or even look like it. All points are valid because your feelings are valid. Right and wrong don’t matter. Laughter and happiness lead to positive solutions. Fatigue, challenge, and resentment leads to negative solutions. An obvious thing I didn’t really realise until now. </p>
        
        
        <blockquote>
            "A tired mind can't think, and a fixated mind can't solve"
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Fear Brain </h2>
            <p> As I contemplate and explore, I come to another very relevant realisation. We say things we don’t mean all the time. </p>
                
            <p> Let me clarify. In a way, we have two minds: the positive mind and the negative mind. When I tap into the negative mind (‘let’s call it the fear mind’) my thoughts become negative. They are still my thoughts and I am thinking them. But they are only my thoughts in that moment, or when my fear/insecurity is active. It’s like wearing glasses that color the world. </p>
            
            <p> There are many things I said that simply aren’t true, whilst in that frame of mind: “I’m carrying the relationship”, “I can’t feel you in any decisions”, “you don’t really value me”. Other things I haven’t fully explained, but the way in which I said it hurt “my sister called it”, “I don’t want to be scattered like your family”. </p>
            
            <p> In that moment, I’m lashing out. Thinking (I sometimes don’t know what I’m thinking until I try voicing anything). It’s true that we, I, must be more careful with my words. Sometimes I’m not as attentive or careful as I should be. </p>
            
            <p> However, when my negative mind is active, only negative thoughts are in it. It is what I’m thinking. It may even be something I have considered before when my negative mind is active. </p>
            
            <p> It doesn’t mean it’s something I believe or think its true. That’s one of the reasons, I ask that things not be held against me; though I’ve only now just realised why I’m making that request. It’s also why I ask there is the ability to take things back and apologise. </p>
            
            <p> I have said many hurtful things over the years, but you’ve always understood instinctively. Just because I say something in a specific frame of mind (fear, anger, despair) doesn’t mean its true. Or that this is what I truly think when my head is level. </p>
