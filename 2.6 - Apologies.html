         <h1> Preface </h1>
         <p>This section is to reflect on the things I have done, said that I would like to apologise for and take back if you would allow it. </p>
         <p>I said many hurtful things I really don’t believe, was rash at times when there was no need for it, and was a bit too sensitive which led to some overreactions. .</p>
         <p> I’m not going to list everything here. But, I shall name the things, I shall name those that have been on my mind. I’m sure there are many more things. </p>

        <h2>Engagement</h2>
           <p>A pivotal time in the past weeks has been when I insisted, we were engaged shortly after our parents spoke. </p>
        <p>Honestly, my vision was that both our families would explore that question when they met; by having an open discussion on what it means to be engaged and whether we were at that point. </p>
        <p>I was rash, and blinded by emotion and this was a very serious mistake:</p>
        <p> First, by ever phrasing the question in the way “engaged or call it off”, I treated you in a terrible way, and opened the door/possibility to you feeling insecure about our relationship or even that it was being used to threaten you. </p>
        <p> It was not my intention to do either of those things, and I sincerely apologise. I would have backed down once I calmed down a bit, but that is no excuse.  </p>
        <p> I didn’t recognise this was happening at the time for two reasons: 1) I was seriously triggered, and 2) I wanted to show my family that I wasn’t like my uncles. </p>
        <p> I let my judgement get clouded by the intense emotions I was experiencing at the time. Whether my loss of composure is justified or not, it caused damage, I hope to repair.</p>
        <p> Second, there was a cultural dimension we didn’t quite understand. I erred by not taking the time to understand it fully, instead of us sitting down and discussing it properly, I got triggered and started acting unilaterally. This was bad because it in a way cut you out, and made you feel I was going to make decisions on my own.</p>
        <p> Nothing could be further from the truth, and I apologise. It was hurtful, please allow me to take it back.</p>
        
        <h2>Playing</h2>
               <p>Another thing I had been thinking about was the two times we played (painfully) since your family came in June. I had promised you not to play at all while they are here. </p>
                <p>This was purely a loss of self-control on my part. I’ve been a lot of stress and feeling very isolated. This gives me some relief and helps me connect. It gives me comfort and I couldn’t resist the impulse.</p>
                <p>I did ask if you were comfortable with it throughout, and even though you said you were, I should have stopped it. My failure to do that, may have made you feel bad, ashamed or that I disrespect your parents. </p>
                <p> None of this is true. I tried my best to stop it but was driven by me need for comfort. I’m sorry I fell short. </p>
        
        <h2>Lack of gratitude</h2>

                <p>I had a very specific vision of how I wanted to spend time with your family. This was informed by how we do it in my own culture, not necessarily how you do it in yours. </p>
                <p> This led me to not express my appreciation and gratitude for many things and may have led you to feel that I didn’t value the effort and actions you took to try to make me feel included:</p>
                <p> Your family’s invitation for lunch during your graduation, and ghorme sabzi. The gifts/food your mother sent me. The extreme kindness each member of your family always showed me.</p>
                <p> The time you spent with me, even though you wanted to spend every second with your family. You asking about my feelings concerning contact and making an effort to call more frequently. Inviting me to come out with you and your sister. Inviting me out with you and Kimia.</p>
                <p> Outside your family being here, there are many things I don’t maybe express as much gratitude towards as I should. The adjustments you make concerning play time, the time you take to listen to me when you are exhausted. The ways you try to pamper me and express love. </p>
                <p> I will say this khosghellam. I never take anything you do for granted, because I value you more highly than you can imagine. I also try to convey my appreciation in my way. However, I am starting to think that maybe I don’t convey my gratitude in the way you would like to hear. </p>
                <p> Sometimes, I say and do things you don’t like and can make you feel that I don’t notice your effort, appreciate it or care. At times I say things I don’t mean in the moment, or because I’m thinking with my negative brain during moments of insecurity.</p>
               <p> It is never my intention to make you or your effort feel unappreciated or undervalued. I’m sorry if I ever make you feel that way, and I shall be more mindful to express myself in a way that reaches you. </p>
