        <h2>Engagement</h2>
            <p> The way I insisted we were engaged was not the right thing to do. It wasn’t something I was convinced I should, I however largely did it because I didn’t want to appear any less in my family’s eyes. This was misguided.  </p>

            <p> By posing the question “engaged or call it off” I made a terrible error. It may have felt that I was forcing you into it or perhaps giving you an ultimatum. In my defence, I would have backed off when i calmed down, stopped being triggered (explained later), and openly discussed why i wanted to do that with you so we can devise a way forward together.</p>  
            
                <p>There was also the cultural dimension we didn’t quite understand was at odds. As I previously explained, in my culture an engagement is when the couple decides they want to marry and the families get involved.</p>
                
                <p> However, truthfully, I wasn’t thinking very clearly at that point. I felt this question should have been explored when both our families got together, and we had an open discussion on what it means to be engaged.</P>
                
                <p> It was hurtful, (i feel) unlike me and I am truly sorry.</p>
        

                <h2>Playing</h2>
                <p>There is another thing I wanted to apologise for is for loosing control and playing (painfully) twice in the two and a half months your parents were here.</p>
                 
                <p> It’s no excuse, but the truth is I really needed some comfort in those moments from all the stress I was experiencing. However, all I achieved was upsetting you/making you feel weird.</p>
     
                <p> I really did do my best to control that impulse, I think you saw that and wanted to help. But I shouldn’t have put you in that position. </p>
     
                <p> I tried my best. Sometimes I fall short, and sometimes its not in my ability. I’m sorry if this is something that bothered you. </p>
       

        <h2>Not being grateful</h2>

                <p> As i reflect, i also realise there is alot i havent expressed enough grateful for. </p>

                <p> Sharing your mother's precious gifts/food, inviting me for that ghorme sabzi lunch, inviting me to the graduation party, and trying to carry me when i was feeling down </p>

                <p> I'm also grateful you chose to come out with me, take my calls and calling me frequently when your parents were here </p>

               <p> I sometimes dont express my gratitude as i should. But I have always noticed and appreciated everything you do and try. Even if i may say differntly in the wrong state of mind. </p>
            
               <p> I try so hard, because i never take anything you do for granted, and i  value you mroe hihgly than you can imagine. </p>
            
               <p> however, my words are sometimes not nice and can make you feel i dont notice or care "i.e i carry this everything, i'm the only one reaching out". Nothing can be further from the truth</p>
            
               <p> I'm sorry i make you feel unappreciated in my moments of insecurity, stress or weakness</p>
